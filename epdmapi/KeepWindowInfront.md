When
an add-in displays a dialog box, the add-in needs to keep the dialog box in
front of whatever window launched it. Failure to do so may result
in the dialog box disappearing and the user
becoming confused.

## C++

To keep the dialog box in the foreground, you can
specify a
parent window handle when the new dialog box is created.

## **VB.NET or C#**

Window handling is supported in
SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 6.4 and later. In SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional 6.4 only, you must also enable the
Multithreaded Add-ins Threading policy.

Unlike Visual Basic 6, VB.NET and C# allow you to create add-in modules that support
multi-threading. When
SOLIDWORKS
PDM Professional runs a multi-threaded NET add-in, it executes it in the same thread
as the parent window. Calls to
[IEdmVault5::SetAddInWnd](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmVault5~SetAddInWnd.html),
which were previously recommended for Visual Basic 6, are no longer necessary.

To keep an add-in window in the foreground, call
[IEdmVault8::GetWin32Window](EPDM.Interop.epdm~EPDM.Interop.epdm.IEdmVault8~GetWin32Window.html)
in the .NET form of your add-in to specify the handle of the parent window.
