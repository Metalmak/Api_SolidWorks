# Access Data Example (VBA)

[View Code](Access_Selections_Example_VB_Code.htm)

All features have a feature data object that contains specific information
about each instance of the feature.  For
example, an extrude feature contains an IExtrudeFeatureData2 object that
contains the parameters for the extrude's depth. The
IExtrudeFeatureData2::AccessSelections method is called to allow a program to
modify a feature data object.  After
making the changes, call IFeature::ModifyDefinition to implement the changes to
the feature and release control of the feature data object. A call to
IExtrudeFeatureData2::ReleaseSelectionAccess also releases control of the
feature data object.

This example shows how to access and modify the data specific to a certain
feature in a SOLIDWORKS part or assembly. To use this example, open a part with
a base extrusion and select the base extrusion.

1. Attach the program to SOLIDWORKS, get the active model,
   and access the ISelectionManager.

   Set swApp =
   CreateObject("sldWorks.application")

   Set Model = swApp.ActiveDoc

   Set SelMgr = Model.SelectionManager
2. Obtain the selected feature, and extract the feature data
   Object from the feature.

   Set CurFeature = SelMgr.GetSelectedObject5(1)

   Set FeatData = CurFeature.GetDefinition
3. Get the permissions to access the parameters of the
   feature.

   isGood = FeatData.AccessSelections(Model,
   Component)
4. Modify the feature data, in this case double the depth of
   the extrude.

   Depth = FeatData.GetDepth(True)

   FeatData.SetDepth
   True, Depth \* 2
5. Implement the changes in the model.

   isGood = CurFeature.ModifyDefinition(FeatData,
   Model, Component)
6. If the Feature::ModifyDefinition call fails for any
   reason, release the access permissions for the feature data.

   FeatData.ReleaseSelectionAccess
