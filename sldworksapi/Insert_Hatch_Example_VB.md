'------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open a drawing containing a closed sketch similar to the
'    sketch shown.
' 2. Select an arc.
' 3. Change the name of the arc in this code to match name of
'    of the arc selected in step 2 (e.g., record selecting the
'    arc, save the recording to a new macro, open and inspect
'    that macro, and make note of the name of the selected arc).
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. Inserts and scales the hatch.
' 2. Examine the drawing.
