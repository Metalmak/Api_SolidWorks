# ![](dotnetimages/collapse.gif)Remarks

Dimension of coefficient vectors dim:

* For rational curves dim = 4.

  * For non-rational curves dim = 3.

Order of each segment of the curve order:

1. The order of the curve = degree + 1.

   - The minimum order is 2.

Number of segments in the curve nseg:

* There must be at least one segment (nseg >= 1).

  * Adjacent segments must meet.

Coefficient data coeffs:

* Contains order \* nseg vectors of dimension dim. If dim = 3, then the vectors are 3-D vectors giving the x, y and z components. If dim = 4, then each vector has a weight (w) associated with it, and x, y, z and w components are supplied for each vector. The weights supplied must be greater than 0.

  * The coefficients are supplied in order, segment by segment.

    * The interpretation of the coefficients depends on the representation method chosen; this is determined by the value of the argument basis.

Representation method basis:

The expressions for each segment of the B-curve P(t) in the various representations are shown next. For generality, the rational form is given.

The simplification to the non-rational form can be obtained by setting both the weights and the denominator equal to 1.0

Polynomial coefficients:

The curve equation is given by a rational polynomial of order 'order':

                        n                     n

                        --         i        / --     i

          P(t)   =   >   w  A  t     /   >  w  t

                        --   i  i    /        --  i

                        i=0                 i=0

          where n = order-1

                A = polynomial coefficient

                  i

                w = weight for A

                  i              i

The polynomial coefficients are supplied starting with the constant  term and ending with the term of highest degree.
