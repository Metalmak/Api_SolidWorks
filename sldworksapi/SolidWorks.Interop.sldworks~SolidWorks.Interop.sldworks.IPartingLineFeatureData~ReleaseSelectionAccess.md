# ![](dotnetimages/collapse.gif)Remarks

[IPartingLineFeatureData::AccessSelections](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IPartingLineFeatureData~AccessSelections.html) puts the model in a rollback state to allow access to the selections that define the parting line feature.

Use this method to restore the rollback state if you did not modify the feature, or use [IFeature::ModifyDefinition](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.html) or [IFeature::IModifyDefinition2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~IModifyDefinition2.html) if you did modify the feature.
