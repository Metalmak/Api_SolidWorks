#### Property Value

True to reverse the direction of the length ratio offset from the end of the second member, false to not

# ![](dotnetimages/collapse.gif)Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) Syntax

See SecondaryMemberBetweenPointsFeatureData::RevDirectionLengthRatioMember2.

# ![](dotnetimages/collapse.gif)Remarks

This property is valid only if [ISecondaryMemberBetweenPointsFeatureData::SecondaryMemberOffsetType](SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISecondaryMemberBetweenPointsFeatureData~SecondaryMemberOffsetType.html) is set to swSecondaryMemberBetweenPointsDistanceFromEndType\_e.swSecondaryMemberBetweenPointsDistanceFromEndType\_LengthRatio.
