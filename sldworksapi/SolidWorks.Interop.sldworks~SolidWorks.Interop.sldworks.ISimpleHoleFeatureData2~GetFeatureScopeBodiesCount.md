#### Return Value

Number of solid bodies affected

# ![](dotnetimages/collapse.gif)Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) Syntax

See SimpleHoleFeatureData2::GetFeatureScopeBodiesCount.

# ![](dotnetimages/collapse.gif)Remarks

Call this method before calling [ISimpleHoleData2::IGetFeatureScopeBodies](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISimpleHoleFeatureData2~IGetFeatureScopeBodies.html) to get the size of the array for that method.

 If [ISimpleHoleFeatureData2::FeatureScope](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ISimpleHoleFeatureData2~FeatureScope.html) is false, then count is 0.
