*ColUndercut1*
:   Value (COLORREF type) that specifies the color for the faces invisible from one direction that form an undercut

*ColUndercut2*
:   Value (COLORREF type) that specifies the color for the faces invisible from a second direction that form an undercut

*ColOccluded*
:   Value (COLORREF type) that specifies the color for the faces invisible from both directions that form an undercut

*ColStraddle*
:   Value (COLORREF type) that specifies the color for the faces with draft in both directions that form an undercut

*ColBase*
:   Value (COLORREF type) that specifies the color for the faces that do not form undercuts; that is, all faces except the undercut faces

*BCoordInput*
:   True to enable coordinate input to control the direction of pull, false to not

*Dx*
:   x coordinate to control the direction of pull

*Dy*
:   y coordinate to control the direction of pull

*Dz*
:   z coordinate to control the direction of pull

Detects trapped, also called undercut, areas in a model that cannot be ejected from the mold.
