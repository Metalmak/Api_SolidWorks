This example shows how to create a derived or underived sketch.

```
'--------------------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open a part that contains at least one sketch.
' 2. Select a sketch.
' 3. Open the Immediate window.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. If the selected sketch is not derived, then a
'    derived sketch is created.
'    - or -
'    If the selected sketch is derived, then the
'    sketch is changed to underived.
' 2. Examine the FeatureManager design tree and Immediate
'    window.
