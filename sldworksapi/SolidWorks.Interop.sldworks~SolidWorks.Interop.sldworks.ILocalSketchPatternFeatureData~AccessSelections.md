*TopDoc*
:   Top-level document (see **Remarks**)

*Component*
:   Component in which the feature is to be modified (see **Remarks**)

Gains access to the selections used to define this sketch-driven component pattern feature.

# ![](dotnetimages/collapse.gif).NET Syntax

| Visual Basic (Declaration) |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` Function AccessSelections( _    ByVal TopDoc As System.Object, _    ByVal Component As System.Object _ ) As System.Boolean ``` | |

| Visual Basic (Usage) | ![](dotnetimages/copycode.gif)Copy Code |
| --- | --- |
| ``` Dim instance As ILocalSketchPatternFeatureData Dim TopDoc As System.Object Dim Component As System.Object Dim value As System.Boolean   value = instance.AccessSelections(TopDoc, Component) ``` | |

| C# |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` System.bool AccessSelections(     System.object TopDoc,    System.object Component ) ``` | |

| C++/CLI |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` System.bool AccessSelections(  &   System.Object^ TopDoc, &   System.Object^ Component ) ``` | |

**NOTE:** See [Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm).

#### Parameters

*TopDoc*
:   Top-level document (see **Remarks**)

*Component*
:   Component in which the feature is to be modified (see **Remarks**)

#### Return Value

True if the selections are successfully accessed, false if not

# ![](dotnetimages/collapse.gif)Remarks

| --- | --- |
| **To modify a feature in a...** | **Then...** |
| Part | * TopDoc argument is the [IModelDoc2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2.html) for the part* Component argument is NULL |
| Assembly | * TopDoc is the IModelDoc2 object for the assembly* Component argument is the [IComponent2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IComponent2.html) object in which the feature is to be modified |

This method puts the model into a rollback state to allow access to the selections that define this feature. You must use either of the following methods to restore the rollback state:

* [IFeature::ModifyDefinition](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.html) if you modified the feature

  * [ILocalSketchPatternFeatureData::ReleaseSelectionAccess](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ILocalSketchPatternFeatureData~ReleaseSelectionAccess.html) if you did not
