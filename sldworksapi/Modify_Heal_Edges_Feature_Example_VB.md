# Modify Heal Edges Feature Example (VBA)

This example shows how to modify an existing heal edges feature.

```
'---------------------------------------------------
' Preconditions:
' 1. Open a part document that contains
'    an imported part with the edges of four faces
'    merged in a heal edges feature.
' 2. Edit the heal edges feature to verify that
'    four faces are listed in Faces in the Heal
'    Edges PropertyManager page.
' 3. Close the PropertyManager page.
'
' Postconditions:
' 1. At stop, press the Ctrl key while selecting
'    two faces, then press F5.
' 2. Modifies the heal edges feature
'    so that the edges of the two selected
'    faces are merged.
' 3. Edit the heal edges feature to verify
'    that only two faces are listed in Faces
'    in the Heal Edges PropertyManager page and
'    examine the graphics area.
