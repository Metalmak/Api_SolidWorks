# Get Blocks in Drawing Example (VBA)

This example shows how to get a block definition and its block instances
in a drawing.

'---------------------------------------------------

'

' Precondition:

'          (1)
Drawing is open that contains at least

'              one
block definition with at least one

'              block
instance.

'          (2)
The block definition is selected in the

'              FeatureManager
design tree.

'

' Postconditions: None
