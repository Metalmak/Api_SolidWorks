# Get Notes from New or Existing Title Block (VBA)

This example shows how to create a title block in a drawing, if one
does not already exist, and how to get the notes from an existing title
block in a drawing.

'--------------------------------------------------------

' Preconditions: Drawing document is open.

'

' Postconditions: If the drawing contains a title block,
then

'                 notes
of that block are printed

'                 to
the Immediate window. If not, then

'                 a
title block is created.
