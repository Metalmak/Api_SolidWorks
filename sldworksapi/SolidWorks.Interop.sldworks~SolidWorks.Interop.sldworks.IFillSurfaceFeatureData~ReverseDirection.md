#### Property Value

True to reverse direction while merging results, false to not

# ![](dotnetimages/collapse.gif)Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) Syntax

See FillSurfaceFeatureData::ReverseDirection.

# ![](dotnetimages/collapse.gif)Remarks

When patching a solid with a fill surface, there are often two possible results. Use this method to reverse direction while merging results if the fill surface displays in an unwanted direction. See [IFillSurfaceFeatureData::Merge](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFillSurfaceFeatureData~Merge.html) for details about merging results.
