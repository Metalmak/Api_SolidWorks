# ![](dotnetimages/collapse.gif)Remarks

The difference between this method and [IView::GetPolylines6](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IView~GetPolylines6.html) and [IView::IGetPolylines6](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IView~IGetPolylines6.html) is that splines and ellipses returned by this method are returned as equation parameters, which are more precise definitions.

This method returns data for all visible solid model edges in the drawing view. This includes these types of edges:

* arcs: Returned using a center point, radius, and start and stop location.

  * circles: Returned using a center point, radius, and start and stop location.

    * ellipses: Returned as equation parameters.

      * splines: Returned as equation parameters.

        * straight lines: Returned as tessellated polylines, but because the edges are straight, there is no loss of data in the approximation.

          * For each arc:

            * first double gives the type

              * next double gives the number of doubles required to hold arc geometry ( center, startPt, endPt, normal ) == 12

                * next three doubles give the coordinates of center

                  * next three doubles give the coordinates of startPt

                    * next three doubles give the coordinates of endPt

                      * next three doubles give the coordinates of the normal

                        * next six doubles are line attributes

                          * LineColor = polyline color. This value is determined either by the explicitly set value or by the layer that the polyline is on.* LineStyle = value combines polyline font and weight information. This value can be used as an input to GetLineFontInfo and GetLineFontName. If this value is -1, then the user has probably modified the line display manually in the drawing and you should use the LineFont and LineWeight return values to recreate the exact polyline style.* LineFont = value is used for polyline font information. This value can be used as an input to the GetLineFontInfo2 and GetLineFontName2 functions. This value will only be valid if LineStyle is -1.* LineWeight = polyline weight where Thin = 0.0, Normal = 1.0, Thick = 2.0. This value will only be valid if LineStyle is -1.* LayerID = integer value indicating which layer holds this polyline. The [ILayer](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ILayer.html) object can be obtained by passing this integer value to [ILayerMgr::GetLayerById](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ILayerMgr~GetLayerById.html) and [ILayerMgr::IGetLayerById](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ILayerMgr~IGetLayerById.html).* LayerOverride = integer with bit flags set to determine which properties, if any, have been overridden with respect to the Layer default properties. If the bit value is set, then the specific property or properties have been overridden. The bit indicators are: color = 0x1, style = 0x2, and width = 0x4. Therefore, if LayerOverride was returned as 3, you know the color and style have been specifically set for this item and may not match the default values associated with this item's layer.* next double is the number of points lying on the arc

                                        * next ( numPoints \* 3 ) doubles are the coordinates of points lying on the arc

                                          * For each ellipse:

                                            * first double gives the type

                                              * next double gives the number of doubles required to hold ellipse geometry ( center, unit vector along majorAxis, unit vector along minor axis, major radius, minor radius, startPt, endPt, normal ) == 17

                                                * next three doubles give the coordinates of center

                                                  * next three doubles give the coordinates of unit vector along major axis

                                                    * next three doubles give the coordinates of unit vector along minor axis

                                                      * next doubles gives the major radius

                                                        * next double gives the minor radius

                                                          * next three doubles give the coordinates of startPt

                                                            * next three doubles give the coordinates of endPt

                                                              * next six doubles are line attributes

                                                                * next double is the number of points lying on the ellipse

                                                                  * next ( numPoints \* 3 ) doubles are the coordinates of points lying on the ellipse

                                                                    * For each spline

                                                                      * first double gives the type

                                                                        * next double gives the number of doubles required to hold the information about the spline geometry ( 5 + numCtrlPts\* numDims + numKnot ); if the spline is rational, numDims ==4 otherwise numDims ==3

                                                                          * next double gives degree = order -1

                                                                            * next double gives numDims ( i.e., number of coordinates associated with each control point; if the spline is rational , these are four, else three)

                                                                              * next double gives the number of control points of the spline

                                                                                * next double gives the number of knots on the spline

                                                                                  * next ( numCtlPoints\*numDims ) number of doubles are the coordinates of control points; each control point has numDims number of coordinates

                                                                                    * next "numKnots" number of doubles; the knots on the spline

                                                                                      * next six doubles are line attributes

                                                                                        * next double is the number of points lying on the spline

This method also lets you include or exclude crosshatch lines. This method does not return data for sketch segments added by a user in the drawing view.

Use [IView::SetDisplayMode3](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IView~SetDisplayMode3.html) to change Shaded or Shaded with Edges mode to Wireframe, Hidden Lines Removed (HLR), or Hidden Lines Visible (HLV), and then get the polylines. |

| Drawing is already open | All polylines in the drawing are generated. If you open a drawing that is zoomed in to a particular region, then the polylines that are outside the zoomed region do not exist if the parts or assemblies shown in this drawing have been changed.
