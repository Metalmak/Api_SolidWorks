#### Property Value

True to automatically select all bodies, false to select specific bodies for [IExtrudeFeatureData2::FeatureScopeBodies](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IExtrudeFeatureData2~FeatureScopeBodies.html) and [IExtrudeFeatureData2::ISetFeatureScopeBodies](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IExtrudeFeatureData2~ISetFeatureScopeBodies.html)

# ![](dotnetimages/collapse.gif)Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) Syntax

See ExtrudeFeatureData2::AutoSelect.

# ![](dotnetimages/collapse.gif)Remarks

This property is only available when the [IExtrudeFeatureData2::FeatureScope](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IExtrudeFeatureData2~FeatureScope.html) property is true. The extrude feature is expanded along the plane on which the feature is created and selects all or only the specified bodies it intersects.

See Accessing Selections that Define Features for additional details.
