# Select All Fillets Example (VBA)

Selecting all of the fillets on an active part is done by iterating
through all of the features with IModelDoc2::FirstFeature and IFeature::GetNextFeature.
For each feature, check the type with IFeature::GetTypeName and compare
it to the "Fillet" and "VarFillet" constants to see
if the current feature is a fillet.  If
the feature is a fillet, then place the fillet in an IEntity object and
select the entity.
