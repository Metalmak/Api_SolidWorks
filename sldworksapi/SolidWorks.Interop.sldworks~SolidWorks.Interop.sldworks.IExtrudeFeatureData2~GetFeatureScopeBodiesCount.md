#### Return Value

Number of solid bodies affected

# ![](dotnetimages/collapse.gif)Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) Syntax

See ExtrudeFeatureData2::GetFeatureScopeBodiesCount.

# ![](dotnetimages/collapse.gif)Remarks

Call this method before calling [IExtrudeFeatureData2::IGetFeatureScopeBodies](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IExtrudeFeatureData2~IGetFeatureScopeBodies.html).

If [IExtrudeFeatureData2::FeatureScope](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IExtrudeFeatureData2~FeatureScope.html) is false, then count will be 0.
