# Get Block Definitions in Part or Assembly Example (VBA)

This example shows how to get all of the block definitions and their
block instances in a part or assembly.

'-----------------------------

'

' Preconditions: Part document is open and contains at
least

'               one
block definition and block instance.

'

' Postconditions: All of the block instances in the part
are selected.
