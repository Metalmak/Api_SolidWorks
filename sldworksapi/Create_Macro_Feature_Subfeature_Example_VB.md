# Create Macro Feature Subfeature Example (VBA)

This example shows how to create a macro feature subfeature.

'---------------------------------------------------------------------------

'

' Preconditions: Model document is open and a sketch is
selected.

'

' Postconditions: The sketch becomes a subfeature of the
newly

'                 created
macro feature named EmptyFeature.

'

' NOTE: A bitmap
named FeatureIcon.bmp for the
macro feature must exist.
