# ![](dotnetimages/collapse.gif)Remarks

[IRevolveFeatureData2::AccessSelections](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IRevolveFeatureData2~AccessSelections.html) and [IRevolveFeatureData2::IAccessSelections](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IRevolveFeatureData2~IAccessSelections.html) put the model in a rollback state to allow access to the selections that define the feature.

Use this method to restore the rollback state if you did not modify the feature, or use [IFeature::ModifyDefinition](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.html) or [IFeature::IModifyDefinition2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~IModifyDefinition2.html) if you did modify the feature.
