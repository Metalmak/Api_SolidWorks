# ![](dotnetimages/collapse.gif).NET Syntax

| Visual Basic (Declaration) |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` Function IAccessSelections( _    ByVal TopDoc As ModelDoc2, _    ByVal Component As Component2 _ ) As System.Boolean ``` | |

| --- | --- |
| ``` Dim instance As IDraftFeatureData2 Dim TopDoc As ModelDoc2 Dim Component As Component2 Dim value As System.Boolean   value = instance.IAccessSelections(TopDoc, Component) ``` | |

| C# |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` System.bool IAccessSelections(     ModelDoc2 TopDoc,    Component2 Component ) ``` | |

| C++/CLI |  |

**NOTE:** See [Differences Between Unmanaged C++ and C++/CLI Code](DifferencesBetweenUnManagedAndCPPCLI.htm).

#### Parameters

*TopDoc*
:   Top-level document

*Component*
:   Component in which the feature is to be modified

#### Return Value

# ![](dotnetimages/collapse.gif)Remarks

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **To modify a feature in a...** | **Then...** |
| Part | * TopDoc argument is the [IModelDoc2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2.html) for the part* Component argument is NULL |
| Assembly | * TopDoc is the IModelDoc2 object for the assembly* Component argument is the [IComponent2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IComponent2.html) object in which the feature is to be modified |

This method puts the model into a rollback state to allow access to the selections that define this feature. You must use either of the following methods to restore the rollback state:

* [IFeature::IModifyDefintion2](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~IModifyDefinition2.html) if you modified the feature

  * [IDraftFeatureData2::ReleaseSelectionAccess](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IDraftFeatureData2~ReleaseSelectionAccess.html) if you did not
