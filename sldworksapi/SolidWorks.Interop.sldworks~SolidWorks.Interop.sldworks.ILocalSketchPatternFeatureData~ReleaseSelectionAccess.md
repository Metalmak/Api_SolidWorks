# ![](dotnetimages/collapse.gif)Remarks

[ILocalSketchPatternFeatureData::AccessSelections](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.ILocalSketchPatternFeatureData~AccessSelections.html) puts the model into a rollback state to allow access to the selections that define this feature.

Use this method to restore the rollback state if you did not modify the feature, or use [IFeature::ModifyDefinition](SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature~ModifyDefinition.html) if you did.
