# Recognizing Features Interactively (VBA)

This sample application illustrates recognizing a feature interactively
in a SOLIDWORKS part document, and then creating that feature.

Sub main()

    Dim
swApp As Object

    Dim
sample As Object

    Dim
Part As Object

    Dim
boolstatus As Boolean

    Dim
str As String

    Set
swApp = Application.SldWorks

    swApp.SetUserPreferenceIntegerValue
swAutoSaveInterval, 0

    Set
sample = swApp.GetAddInObject("FeatureWorks.FeatureWorksApp")

    Dim
varOut As Variant

    Dim
var1 As Boolean

    Set
Part = swApp.ActiveDoc

    Set
Part = swApp.ActiveDoc

    boolstatus
= Part.Extension.SelectByID("", "FACE", 0.1165311335518,
-0.006695921966639, 0.03257260156937, False, 0, Nothing)

    Dim
InterOption As Integer

    str
= "Fillet" 'Option to recognize interactive fillet

    InterOption
= fwChainFeatures 'Turn on the chaining option.

    varOut
= sample.RecognizeFeatureInteractive(str,
InterOption)

    If
(False = varOut) Then MsgBox ("ERROR")

    createOption
= fwAllowFailFeatureCreation 'Option to allow creation of features with
rebuild errors

    var1
= sample.CreateFeatures(createOption)

If (False = var1) Then MsgBox ("ERROR")

End Sub
