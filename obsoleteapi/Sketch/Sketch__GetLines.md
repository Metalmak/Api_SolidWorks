# Sketch::GetLines

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by Sketch::GetLines2.

Description

This method returns information about each line in this sketch.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Sketch.GetLines ()

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray |

Syntax (COM)

status = Sketch->IGetLines ( retval
)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (double\*) retval | Pointer to an array of doubles |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The return value is the following array of doubles:

[ LineType, StartPtX, StartPtY, StartPtZ, EndPtX,
EndPtY, EndPtZ, ... ]

where this array of 7 values repeats
itself for each line in the sketch. The number of doubles returned is
(lineCount \* 7). To determine
the number of lines in the sketch, see Sketch::GetLineCount.

LineStyle may take one of the values in swLineTypes\_e.

See Sketch::GetSketchSegments or Sketch::IEnumSketchSegments for access
to individual SketchSegment and SketchLine objects.
