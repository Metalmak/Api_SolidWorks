# Sketch::AutoDimension

This method is obsolete and
has been superseded by Sketch::AutoDimension2.

Description

This method automatically
dimensions the sketch.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

status = Sketch.AutoDimension ( entitiesToDimension,
horizontalScheme, horizontalPlacement, verticalScheme, verticalPlacement
)

#

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) entitiesToDimension | Entities to dimension as defined in swAutodimEntities\_e |
| Input: | (long) horizontalScheme | Horizontal dimensioning scheme as defined in swAutodimScheme\_e |
| Input: | (long) horizontalPlacement | Placement relative to the sketch of the horizontal dimensions as defined in swAutodimHorizontalPlacement\_e |
| Input: | (long) verticalScheme | Vertical dimensioning scheme as defined in swAutodimScheme\_e |
| Input: | (long) verticalPlacement | Placement relative to the sketch of the vertical dimensions as defined in swAutodimVerticalPlacement\_e |
| Output: | (long) status | swAutodimStatusSuccess if the sketch is automatically dimensioned successfully; see swAutodimStatus\_e for values for possible failures |

#

Syntax (COM)

status = Sketch->AutoDimension ( entitiesToDimension,
horizontalScheme, horizontalPlacement, verticalScheme, verticalPlacement,
&status )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) entitiesToDimension | Entities to dimension as defined in swAutodimEntities\_e |
| Input: | (long) horizontalScheme | Horizontal dimensioning scheme as defined in swAutodimScheme\_e |
| Input: | (long) horizontalPlacement | Placement relative to the sketch of the horizontal dimensions as defined in swAutodimHorizontalPlacement\_e |
| Input: | (long) verticalScheme | Vertical dimensioning scheme as defined in swAutodimScheme\_e |
| Input: | (long) verticalPlacement | Placement relative to the sketch of the vertical dimensions as defined in swAutodimVerticalPlacement\_e |
| Output: | (long) status | swAutodimStatusSuccess if the sketch is automatically dimensioned successfully; see swAutodimStatus\_e for values for possible failures |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

If the entitiesToDimension
argument takes the value swAutodimEntitiesSelected, then use ModelDocExtension::SelectByID
with a mark value of swAutodimMarkEntities to select the sketch entities
to dimension.

Select and mark a unique sketch
point or vertical sketch line as the datum for the horizontal dimensioning
scheme, using swAutodimMarkHorizontalDatum as the mark value. Similarly,
select a unique sketch point or horizontal sketch line as the datum for
the vertical dimensioning scheme, using swAutodimMarkVerticalDatum as
the mark value.
