# Sketch::GetParabolas

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by Sketch::GetParabolas2.

Description

This method gets all of the
parabolas in the sketch.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Sketch.GetParabolas ( )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray (See Remarks) |

Syntax (COM)

status = Sketch->IGetParabolas (
&retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (double) retval | Pointer to an array of doubles (See Remarks) |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

See Sketch::GetSketchSegments or Sketch::IEnumSketchSegments
for access to individual SketchSegment and SketchParabola objects.

The return values are in an array of doubles:

[ Unused, LineType, Unused, Unused, StartPt[3],
EndPt[3], FocusPt[3], ApexPt[3] ...
]

where:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Unused : | This return value is unused and is returned as 0. |
| LineType : | Line type. Valid returns are defined in swLineTypes\_e. A lineType is a combination of a lineStyle and lineWeight. |
| Unused : | This return value is unused and is returned as 0. |
| Unused : | This return value is unused and is returned as 0. |
| StartPt[3] : | Array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the parabola start point |
| EndPt[3] : | Array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the parabola end point. |
| FocusPt[3] : | Array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the parabola focus point. |
| ApexPt[3] : | Array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the parabola apex point. |

This set of data repeats for each parabola in the sketch. The size of
the array is (NumParabolas \* 16). To determine the number of parabolas,
see Sketch::GetParabolaCount.
