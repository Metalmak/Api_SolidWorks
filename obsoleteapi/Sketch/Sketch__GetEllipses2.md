# Sketch::GetEllipses2

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by Sketch::GetEllipses3.

Description

This method gets all of the
ellipses in the sketch.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Sketch.GetEllipses2 ( )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray (see Remarks) |

Syntax (COM)

status = Sketch->IGetEllipses2 (
&retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (double) retval | Pointer to an array of doubles (see Remarks) |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if Successful |

Remarks

See Sketch::GetSketchSegments or Sketch::IEnumSketchSegments
for access to individual SketchSegment and SketchEllipse objects.

The return values are in an array of doubles:

[ Unused, LineType, Unused, Unused, StartPt[3],
EndPt[3], CenterPt[3], MajorPt[3], MinorPt[3],Direction ... ]

where:

| Unused : | This return value is unused,and is returned as 0. |
| LineType : | Line type. Valid returns are defined in swLineTypes\_e. A lineType is a combination of a lineStyle and lineWeight. |
| Unused : | This return value is unused and is returned as 0. |
| Unused : | This return value is unused and is returned as 0. |
| StartPt[3] : | An array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the ellipse start point |
| EndPt[3] : | An array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the ellipse end point. If the ellipse is closed, then this will be the same point as the StartPt. |
| CenterPt[3] : | An array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the ellipse center point. |
| MajorPt[3] : | An array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing a point on the ellipse and on the major axis. |
| MinorPt[3] : | An array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing a point on the ellipse and on the minor axis. |
| Direction : | -1 for clockwise, +1 for counter-clockwise. |

This set of data repeats for each ellipse in the sketch. The size of
the array is (NumEllipses \* 20). To determine the number of ellipses,
see Sketch::GetEllipseCount.
