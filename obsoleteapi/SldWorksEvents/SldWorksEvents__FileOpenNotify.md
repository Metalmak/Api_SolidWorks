# FileOpenNotify - SldWorks Event

This
event is obsolete and has been superseded by SldWorks
event FileOpenNotify2.

Description

Post-notifies the user program
when an existing file has been opened. SldWorks::GetOpenDocumentByName
can then be used with FileName
to get a pointer to the newly opened document.

status = FileOpenNotify ( FileName )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BSTR) FileName | Name of the opened file |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This event is not sent to
any application when a file is opened programmatically using any SldWorks::OpenDoc\*
method. Your application can detect the newly opened document by watching
the ActiveModelDocChangeNotify event.

SldWorks::OpenDoc2 and SldWorks::OpenDoc3
do send this event; however, to detect newly opened documents that are
opened from within some other application that still uses an SldWorks::OpenDoc\*
method, you should still watch for the ActiveModelDocChangeNotify event.
This event is not sent
when the user opens a file in view-only mode. However, an ActiveModelDocChangeNotify
event is sent.

With the exception of Parasolid
files (that is, \*.x\_t, \*.x\_b), this event is not sent for the opening
of non-native SolidWorks files (that is, \*.igs, \*.dxf, and so on).  Non-native
file open are typically handled with the creation of a new SolidWorks
file (that is, \*.sldprt, \*.sldasm, \*.slddrw) and the subsequent construction
of the foreign geometry within that file.
