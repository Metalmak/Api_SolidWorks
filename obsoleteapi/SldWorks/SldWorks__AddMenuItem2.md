Remarks

For information about using this method with the
SwAddin object, see Using SwAddin to Create a SolidWorks Add-in.

You can add a new menu to any one of the four SolidWorks
frames (main, part, assembly, or drawing). To do this, call this method
with the appropriate argument in the DocumentType parameter. For example,
if you want your menu to be available when a part document is active,
then call this method and pass swDocPART
as the first argument. After you have added your menu to the part
frame, you do not need to do it again during the current SolidWorks session.
Once a part document is activated by the user, SolidWorks automatically
displays your menu option.

To add a menu separator, specify an empty string
for HintString:

' Adds a menu separator

 bRet
= iSldWorks.AddMenuItem2(swDocNONE, iCookie, "@Sample", -1,
"DocNONE\_Item", "", "")
