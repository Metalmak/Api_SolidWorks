# SldWorks::AddFileOpenItem

This method is obsolete and has been superceded
by [SldWorks::AddFileOpenItem2](SldWorks__AddFileOpenItem2.htm).

Description

This maethod adds a file type to the SolidWorks File
Open dialog. When a file of the type specified is selected in the
dialog, then the application function specified is called to load the
file.

NOTE: If
your application is unloaded using the Add-In manager, then any file types
added this way must be removed. See SldWorks::RemoveFileOpenItem.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = SldWorks.AddFileOpenItem (
CallbackFcnAndModule, Description)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BSTR) CallbackFcnAndModule | Name of application module and function used to open the file |
| Input: | (BSTR) Description | File extension and description |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if successfully added, FALSE otherwise |

Syntax
(COM)

status = SldWorks->AddFileOpenItem
( CallbackFcnAndModule, Description, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BSTR) CallbackFcnAndModule | Name of module and function used to open the file |
| Input: | (BSTR) Description | File extension and description |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | TRUE if successfully added, FALSE otherwise |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The Description argument specifies the filename extension and a description
that is added to the Files of Type menu
in the File Open dialog. The syntax
is:

"<file extension>\n<description>"

where:

file extension is
the extension for the required files.

description is the text that the user sees in the
Files of Type menu.

For example, if you
have a routine that loads bitmap files, your description might be:

"BMP\nBitmap File (\*.bmp)"

NOTE:
\n must separate these two fields.

The CallbackFcnAndModule argument specifies the application module and
function that is called when a file is to be loaded. The syntax is as
follows:

"dllname@function"

where function
is the name of the function that gets called when the end-user chooses
a file of the type specified. This function must also be declared as an
export in your .def file.

The application function specified is called when a file of the specified
type is selected by the end-user. Two arguments are passed to your callback
function in Unicode format, for example:

#define DllExport
\_\_declspec( dllexport )

void DllExport MyOpenFile(LPTSTR
FileName, LPSLDWORKS pSolidWorks)

{
// Code to load the file
}

The format of the FileName argument is:

 "<FullPath > <FileName>
<AccessType>"

 where:

* FullPath
  is the file name with full path information,
* FileName
  is the file name and extension (without separator)
* AccessType
  is w or r
