Remarks

To add a separator the Item argument , set
to NULL or an empty string.

If the select type is a custom feature (for
example, swSelATTRIBUTES), the menu item appears on the shortcut menu
only if the custom feature name is included in CustomNames.

If the select type is swSelEVERYTHING, the
menu item appears on the shortcut menu of any standard SolidWorks objects.
This does not include the shortuct menu of custom features such as attributes.

The CustomNames argument contains a semi-colon
separated list containing the names of the custom feature types. This
argument is only applicable if SelType is a custom feature type (for example,
swSelATTRIBUTES). If swSelATTRIBUTES,
then this field should be the name of the attribute definition.
