# SldWorks::LoadFile3

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by SldWorks::LoadFile4.

Description

This method loads a non-native
SolidWorks file (for example, \*.igs,
\*.dxf, and
so on).

Syntax (OLE Automation)

Retval = SldWorks.LoadFile3 ( FileName, ArgString,
ImportData)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BSTR) FileName | Full path and filename of the non-native SolidWorks file to import |
| Input: | (BSTR) ArgString | Space-separated string that allows optional arguments to be specified when opening a foreign file (see Remarks) |
| Input: | (LPDISPATCH) ImportData | Pointer to ImportIgesData object (currently only IGES data are supported) |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) Retval | TRUE if the file type is understood, FALSE if the file type is not known  NOTE: This return value does not indicate that the file import is successful; instead, it means that the filename extension is recognized |

#

Syntax (COM)

status = SldWorks->LoadFile3 ( FileName, ArgString,
ImportData, &Retval)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BSTR) FileName | Full path and filename of the non-native SolidWorks file to import |
| Input: | (BSTR) ArgString | Space-separated string that allows optional arguments to be specified when opening a foreign file (see Remarks) |
| Input: | (LPDISPATCH) ImportData | Pointer to ImportIgesData object (currently only IGES data are supported) |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) Retval | TRUE if the file type is understood, FALSE if the file type is not known  NOTE: This return value does not indicate that the file import is successful; instead, it means that the filename extension is recognized |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The general form of ArgString is BOOLEAN and enumerator
arguments, which should be passed as a string.

| If importing a... | Then set ArgString to... |
| DXF/DWG file | a space-separated list:   * <PaperSize> specifies   the sheet size:   -1 = Translator attempts to figure out the sheet size using the foreign file; this is the default if you do not specify any values  0 = A (Horizontal)  1 = A (Vertical)  2 = B  3 = C  4 = D  5 = E  6 = A4  7 = A4 (Vertical)  8 = A3  9 = A2  10 = A1  11 = A0   * <LengthUnit> specifies the default   length units :   -1 = Translator attempts to figure out the default length unit using the foreign file; this is the default if you do not specify any values  0 = MM  1 = CM  2 = METER  3 = INCHES  4 = FEET  5 = FEETINCHES   * <MoveEntities> =   Not used. Specify 0, if necessary. * <ImportToSheetFormat>  + 0   = Import entities to the drawing sheet; this is the default value if you   do not specify a value + 1   = Import entities to the sheet format  Examples To import a DXF/DWG file named Draw1.DXF with a sheet size of A3 and default length units in millimeters:  swApp.LoadFile3 "C:\temp\Draw1.DXF", "8 0", Nothing    To only specify to use default length units in millimeters in <LengthUnit>, you must also specify -1 for <PaperSize>:  swApp.LoadFile3 "C:\temp\Draw1.DXF", "-1 0", NOthing    To only specify to import to the sheet format in  <ImportToSheetFormat>, you must also specify -1 for both <PaperSize> and  <LengthUnit>, and 0 for <MoveEntities>:  swApp.LoadFile3 "C:\temp\Draw1.DXF", "-1 -1 0 1" , Nothing |
| Pro/E file | * To   import features, use  R * To   import geometry, use: * B – Direct   geometry import with knitting * C – Direct   geometry import without knitting * D – Geometry   import with knitting * E – Geometry   import without knitting * S – Surface   geometry import with knitting   These arguments are case sensitive. Specifying one of these options suppresses dialog. |
| Non DXF/DWG and Pro/E files | * To   import the foreign file into a new SolidWorks document, use r * To   insert the foreign file into an existing SolidWorks part document, use   i   For example, to import an IGES file named measuring\_cup.igs into a new SolidWorks document:  swApp.LoadFile3 "D:\Samples\measuring\_cup.IGS", "r", importData  NOTES:     * Whether   or not the result is a surface or solid depends on the import options.   See Import and Export File Options for details. * If   ArgString is set to an empty string,   then dialogs may be presented to the end-user during translation. |
