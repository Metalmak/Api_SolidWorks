# FeatureManager::InsertMoveCopyBody

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by FeatureManager::InsertMoveCopyBody2.

Description

This method moves, rotates,
and makes copies of the selected solid bodies or surfaces.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = FeatureManager.InsertMoveCopyBody ( transX,
transY, transZ, transDist, rotPointX, rotPointY, rotPointZ, rotAngleX,
rotAngleY, rotAngleZ, bCopy, numCopies )

Remarks

This method applies either
to the specified translation or rotation. If you specify both translation
and rotation, only the translation is applied.

See the Insert,
Surface, Move/Copy command in the SolidWorks Help for details about
moving, rotating, and copying solid bodies and surfaces.
