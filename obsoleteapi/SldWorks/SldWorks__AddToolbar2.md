# SldWorks::AddToolbar2

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [SldWorks::AddToolbar3](SldWorks__AddToolbar3.htm).

Description

This method creates a Windows-style, dockable toolbar, containing a
set of application-defined buttons. The toolbar name is entered into the
View, Toolbars menu and the shortcut
 menu of
the frame when the toolbar is added.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = SldWorks.AddToolbar
( moduleName, title, smallBitmapHandle,  largeBitmapHandle,
menuPosition, docTemplateType )

| Input: | (BSTR) moduleName | Name of the module (for example, USERDLL) |
| Input: | (BSTR) title | Name of the toolbar |
| Input: | (long) smallBitmapHandle | Handle of the small bitmap image |
| Input: | (long) largeBitmapHandle | Handle of the large bitmap image |
| Input: | (long) menuPosition | Unused; SolidWorks always puts toolbar names in alphabetical order |
| Input: | (long) docTemplateType | Bitwise values indicating what frame window types should have this toolbar name added to its View, Toolbars menu; values defined by swDocTemplateTypes\_e |
| Return: | (long) retval | The toolbar ID for use with other methods or –1 if not created |

Syntax (COM)

status = SldWorks->AddToolbar2 ( moduleName, title,
smallBitmapHandle, largeBitmapHandle, menuPosition,
docTemplateType, &retval )

| Input: | (BSTR) moduleName | Name of the module (for example, USERDLL) |
| Input: | (BSTR) title | Name of the toolbar |
| Input: | (long) smallBitmapHandle | Handle of the small bitmap image |
| Input: | (long) largeBitmapHandle | Handle of the large bitmap image |
| Input: | (long) menuPosition | Unused; SolidWorks always puts toolbar names in alphabetical order |
| Input: | (long) docTemplateType | Bitwise values indicating what frame window types should have this toolbar name added to its View, Toolbars menu; values defined by swDocTemplateTypes\_e |
| Output: | (long) retval | Toolbar ID for use with other methods or –1 if not created |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method creates the toolbar and passes the image for the buttons
to SolidWorks. To add functionality,  use
SldWorks::AddToolbarCommand.

The bitmap images should contain the bitmaps for each of the buttons
(including separators) in the toolbar as a single bitmap. For the small
bitmap the image for each button must be 16x15, for the large bitmap it
must be 22x22.

One way of creating the bitmaps is to add a toolbar resource to your
Visual C++ project and then load the bitmap for that toolbar into a CBitmap
object

Example toolbar resource in Visual C++

SetResources();  // Local function to make sure
we are using the Add-In resources

m\_SmallToolbar.LoadMappedBitmap(IDR\_TOOLBAR\_SMALL);

HBITMAP hbmSmallImageWell = (HBITMAP)m\_SmallToolbar.GetSafeHandle();

ResetResources();  // Local function to reset
resources to SolidWorks

NOTES:

* If you load your toolbar image into a locally
  declared CBitmap object in a function, then as the function returns and
  the local CBitmap is destroyed, the handle passed to SolidWorks becomes
  invalid and, at best, the buttons are blank.
* When using resources specific to an add-in, it
  is necessary to allocate separate resource space to avoid resource clashes.
* When your add-in is unloaded, you must call SldWorks::RemoveToolbar
  to remove this toolbar.
