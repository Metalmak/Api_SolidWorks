# SketchSpline::GetPoints

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by SketchSpline::GetPoints2.

Description

This method gets the points used when creating
this sketch spline. The points returned are by interpolation instead of
by tessellation as is done by Sketch::GetSplines.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = SketchSpline.GetPoints ( )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray of doubles; these are the x,y,z points used to create the spline |

Syntax (COM)

status = SketchSpline->IGetPoints ( retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (double\*) retval | Array of doubles of size (SketchSpline::GetPointCount \* 3); these are the x,y,z points used to create the spline |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The [ x,y,z
] points returned for this
spline are the same points used to generate the spline. If you want a
tessellated representation of the spline, see Sketch::GetSplines.

For COM implementations, you can determine the
size of the array by multiplying the SketchSpline::GetPointCount return
value by 3.
