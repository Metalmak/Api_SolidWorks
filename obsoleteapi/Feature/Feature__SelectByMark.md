# Feature::SelectByMark

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by Feature::Select2.

Description

This method selects and marks this feature.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Feature.SelectByMark ( appendFlag, mark
)

| Input: | (BOOL) appendFlag | TRUE appends the feature to the selection list, FALSE replaces the current selection list |
| Input: | (long) mark | Number you want to use as a mark |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if the feature was selected, FALSE if not |

Syntax (COM)

status = Feature->SelectByMark ( appendFlag, mark,
&retval )

| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) appendFlag | TRUE appends the feature to the selection list, FALSE replaces the current selection list |
| Input: | (long) mark | Number you want to use as a mark |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | TRUE if the entity was selected, FALSE if not |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The selection mark is used by other functions that
require multiple selections, such as InsertMfDraft2, InsertSplitLineSil,
and InsertSplitLineProject.

Use [ModelDoc2::SelectByMark](../ModelDoc2/ModelDoc2__SelectByMark.htm)
instead of this method. This method does not work well when a PropertyManager
page is open or a command is running. ModelDoc2::SelectByMark handles
selection correctly whether or not a command is running.
