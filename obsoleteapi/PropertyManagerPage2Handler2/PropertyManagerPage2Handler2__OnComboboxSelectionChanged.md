Remarks

Use this method with the PropertyManagerPagew2Handler2::OnComboxEditChanged
method to  find
out what is in the text box of the combo box, if the user can edit the
text in the text box.

When this method is called,
the control may not yet be updated with the current selection, so the
PropertyManagerPageCombobox::CurrentSelection property is not reliable.
To get the current text, use the Item number that is passed into the method
as the argument to the PropertyManagerPageCombobox::ItemText method.

If the end-user has edited
the text in the text box and then presses the arrow to show or hide the
list box in the combo box, and the text in the text box matches the first
characters in any of the items in the list, then that item is automatically
selected in the list and this method is called, indicating that the selected
item has changed.
