# PropertyManagerPage2Handler2::OnSelectionboxListChanged

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [PropertyManagerPage2Handler3::OnSelectionboxListChanged](../PropertyManagerPage2Handler3/PropertyManagerPage2Handler3__OnSelectionboxListChanged.htm).

Description

This method is called when the end-user changes
the selection list in a selection box on this PropertyManager.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void = PropertyManagerPage2Handler2.OnSelectionboxListChanged
( Id, Count )

#

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) Id | ID of this selection box |
| Input: | (long) Count | Number of items in this selection box |

#

Syntax (COM)

status = PropertyManagerPage2Handler2->OnSelectionboxListChanged
( Id, Count )

|  |  |  |

| Input: | (long) Id | ID of this selection box |
| Input: | (long) Count | Number of items in this selection box |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

#

Remarks

This method is called when
your application uses a selection method, such as ModelDocExtension::SelectByID2,
just as if the selection was made interactively.

Regardless of how many items
the end-user selects, this method is called only once per interactive
box selection. In other words, if the end-user selects six faces using
a box selection, this method is called only once.
