# Entity::Select3

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by Entity::Select4.

Description

This method selects this entity and marks it.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Entity.Select3 ( Append, Mark, Callout )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BOOL) Append | TRUE appends the entity to the selection list, FALSE replaces the current selection list |
| Input: | (long) Mark | Value that you want to use as a selection mark |
| Input: | (LPCALLOUT) Callout | Pointer to the associated callout |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | TRUE if the entity was selected, FALSE if not |

Syntax (COM)

status = Entity->Select3 ( Append, Mark, Callout,
&retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) Append | TRUE appends the entity to the selection list, FALSE replaces the current selection list |
| Input: | (long) Mark | Value that you want to use as a selection mark |
| Input: | (LPCALLOUT) Callout | Pointer to the associated callout |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | TRUE if the entity was selected, FALSE if not |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

When you use this method,
selection behaves differently depending on the command

state of SolidWorks. One case
is when SolidWorks is running a command that has a

dialog box associated with
a selection list box (for example, a feature creation

command such as InsertFillet).
The selection behavior in this case is:

* Selecting
  a new entity appends it to the selection list.
  - or -
* Selecting
  an entity that is already selected deselects the entity.

SolidWorks ignores the Append
argument because the selection is always appended to

the selection list.

The second case is when there
is no command running, which is the default state of

SolidWorks. The original Entity::Select
worked this way:

* Selecting
  a new entity replaces or appends the selection list depending on the Append
  argument.
  - or -
* Selecting
  an entity that is already selected has no effect.

The mark value of a selection
is used by some functions that require multiple selections

(for example, the Insert Draft
command uses selection marks). The mark value indicates

which selection belongs to
which selection box, so the Mark argument applies only

to certain situations within
the first case. If the
Mark argument is not used, pass 0 for this argument.

You can use this method only
with entity objects that you get from the active document.

In other words, if Assembly1
is the active document when you call Entity::Select3,

then you must get the entity
directly from the Assembly1 document. You can do this

using items in the selection
list (for example, SelectionMGr::GetSelectedObject3) or you can traverse
the body of an assembly component (for example, Component2::GetBody and
Body2::GetFirstFace). You cannot obtain the entity from the underlying
part document (for example, Component2::GetModelDoc, PartDoc::Body, or
Body2::GetFirstFace).
