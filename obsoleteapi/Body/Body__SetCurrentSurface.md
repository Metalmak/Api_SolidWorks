# Body::SetCurrentSurface

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by Body2::SetCurrentSurface.

Description

This method places an existing surface object
into a temporary body object that is under construction.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void Body.SetCurrentSurface ( surfaceIn
)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (LPDISPATCH) surfaceIn | Pointer to a Dispatch object, a surface; this surface might have been created using other surface creation routines, such as Modeler::CreateCylindricalSurface |

Syntax (COM)

status = Body->ISetCurrentSurface ( surfaceIn
)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (LPSURFACE) surfaceIn | Pointer to a surface object; this surface might have been created using other surface creation routines, such as Modeler::CreateCylindricalSurface |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method is used with a set of related methods
that construct a body from trimmed surfaces. This method takes a surface
object created elsewhere and adds it to the temporary body object, which
is acting as a placeholder for the trimmed surfaces.

Follow calls to this method with one or more
calls to the trimming-curve creation methods, such as Surface::AddTrimmingLoop2.
Than, trim the surface using Body::CreateTrimmedSurface. After you add
all the surfaces to the body and trim appropriately, you can sew the body
to create an imported SolidWorks body feature using Body::CreateBodyFromSurfaces.
