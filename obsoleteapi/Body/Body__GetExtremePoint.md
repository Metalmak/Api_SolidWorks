# Body::GetExtremePoint

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by Body2::GetExtremePoint.

Description

This method calculates the extreme point of the model in the given direction.

Syntax
(OLE Automation)

retval
= Body.GetExtremePoint ( x, y, z, &outx, &outy, &outz )

| Input: | (double) x | X component of the direction vector |
| Input: | (double) y | Y component of the direction vector |
| Input: | (double) z | Z component of the direction vector |
| Output: | (double) outx | Extreme point X coordinate |
| Output: | (double) outy | Extreme point Y coordinate |
| Output: | (double) outz | Extreme point Z coordinate |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if a point was found, FALSE if it was not |

Syntax
(COM)

status
= Body->GetExtremePoint ( x, y, z, &outx, &outy, &outz,
&found )

| Input: | (double) x | X component of the direction vector |
| Input: | (double) y | Y component of the direction vector |
| Input: | (double) z | Z component of the direction vector |
| Output: | (double) outx | Extreme point X coordinate |
| Output: | (double) outy | Extreme point Y coordinate |
| Output: | (double) outz | Extreme point Z coordinate |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) found | TRUE if a point was found, FALSE if it was not |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This
method returns the furthest possible intersection point between a plane
normal to the specified direction vector and the model, as the plane moves
along the direction vector.

For
example, if the model is a right cube centered on the origin and the direction
vector is (1.0, 1.0, 1.0), then the extreme point is the vertex at (1.0,
1.0, 1.0).

If
there is more than one point (for example, if there is a face perpendicular
to the direction vector), then SolidWorks returns a unique point found
in a deterministic way.
