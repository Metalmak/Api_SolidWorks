# Body::CreateTrimmedSurface

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by Body2::CreateTrimmedSurface.

Description

This method creates a trimmed surface from a base surface and a list
of existing trimming curves assumed to have been already created.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= Body.CreateTrimmedSurface ()

| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if the trimmed surface was created, FALSE if it was not |

Syntax (COM)

status
= Body->CreateTrimmedSurface ( &retval )

| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | TRUE if the trimmed surface was created, FALSE if it was not |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method is the final call in a set of related
functions that are designed to construct a trimmed surface from a base
surface (possibly infinite) and a set of trimming curves. Before you use
this method, you must call one of the base surface creation methods (such
as Body::CreatePlanarSurface) and the trimming-curve creation method Surface::AddTrimmingLoop.

If you want to construct a solid body from trimmed
surfaces, then you must first call PartDoc::CreateNewBody, which arranges
for a place-holder for this trimmed surface.
