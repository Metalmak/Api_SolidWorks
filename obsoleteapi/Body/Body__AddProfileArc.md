# Body::AddProfileArc

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by Body2::AddProfileArc.

Description

This method creates an arc profile curve and returns a pointer to that
curve. This method always creates  a
full circle.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Body.AddProfileArc ( center, axis,
radius, startPoint, endPoint )

| Input: | (VARIANT) center | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z) |
| Input: | (VARIANT) axis | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z) |
| Input: | (double) radius | Desired radius |
| Input: | (VARIANT) startPoint | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z) |
| Input: | (VARIANT) endPoint | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z) |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to Dispatch object, the arc profile curve |

Syntax (COM)

status = Body->IAddProfileArcDLL ( center,
axis, radius, startPoint, endPoint, &retval )

| Input: | (double\*) center | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z) |
| Input: | (double\*) axis | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z) |
| Input: | (double) radius | Desired radius |
| Input: | (double\*) startPoint | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z) |
| Input: | (double\*) endPoint | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z) |
| Output: | (LPCURVE) retval | Pointer to the arc profile curve |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

You can use this method in conjunction with Body::CreateRevolutionSurface
to generate spherical or toroidal surfaces of revolution, or with Body::CreateExtrusionSurface
to generate a tabulated cylinder.
