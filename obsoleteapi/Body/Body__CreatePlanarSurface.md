# Body::CreatePlanarSurface

This method is obsolete and has been superseded by Body2::CreatePlanarSurface.

Description

This method creates a new infinite planar surface.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= Body.CreatePlanarSurface ( vRootPoint, vNormal)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT) vRootPoint | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z) |
| Input: | (VARIANT) vNormal | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z) |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Dispatch pointer to dispatch object, a new planar surface |

Syntax (COM)

status = Body->ICreatePlanarSurfaceDLL
( vRootPoint, vNormal, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double\*) vRootPoint | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z) |
| Input: | (double\*) vNormal | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z) |
| Output: | (LPSURFACE) retval | Pointer to the new planar surface |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

You can use this method with:

* A set of related functions that construct a body
  from trimmed surfaces.
* Trimming curve creation routines (for example,
  Surface::AddTrimmingLoop) to construct a trimmed surface.

Also. see Body::ICreatePlanarTrimSurfaceDLL, which allows you to create
a planar trimmed surface directly from the vertex points.
