# Body::CreateRevolutionSurface

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by Body2::CreateRevolutionSurface.

Description

This method creates a new surface of revolution.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Body.CreateRevolutionSurface ( profileCurve,
axisPoint, axisDirection, profileEndPtParams)

| Input: | (LPDISPATCH) profileCurve | Pointer to a Dispatch object, the profile curve (generatrix) |
| Input: | (VARIANT) axisPoint | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z) |
| Input: | (VARIANT) axisDirection | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z) |
| Input: | (VARIANT) profileEndPtParams | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 2 doubles (uStart,uEnd) (see Remarks) |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Dispatch pointer to dispatch object, a new surface of revolution |

Syntax (COM)

status = Body->ICreateRevolutionSurface ( profileCurve,
axisPoint, axisDirection, profileEndPtParams, &retval )

| Input: | (LPCURVE) profileCurve | Pointer to a Dispatch object, the profile curve (generatrix) |
| Input: | (VARIANT) axisPoint | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z) |
| Input: | (VARIANT) axisDirection | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z) |
| Input: | (VARIANT) profileEndPtParams | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 2 doubles (uStart,uEnd) (see Remarks) |
| Output: | (LPSURFACE\*) retval | Pointer to a new surface of revolution |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

You can use this method in conjunction with a set
of related functions that construct a body from trimmed surfaces. If you
pass in profileEndPtParams, SolidWorks trims the surface in the axial
direction, otherwise it will be infinite. SolidWorks closes the surface
periodic (period [0,2PI]) in the direction of revolution.

You can also use this function in conjunction with
trimming curve creation routines (for example, Surface::AddTrimmingLoop)
to construct a trimmed surface of revolution.

The profileEndPtParams parameters indicate which
part of the curve to spin. SolidWorks uses these parameters only when
the profile curve intersects the revolve axis. You must specify the parameters
in ascending order. SolidWorks extends the curve from the given parameter
range to meet the revolve axis and spins this portion of curve.
