# Body::CreateTempBodyFromSurfaces

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by Body2::CreateTempBodyFromSurfaces.

Description

This method creates a body from a list of existing trimmed surfaces.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= Body.CreateTempBodyFromSurfaces ( )

| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to a dispatch object, the body |

Syntax (COM)

status
= Body->ICreateTempBodyFromSurfaces ( &retval )

| Output: | (LPBODY) retval | Pointer to the temporary body |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method is the last in a set of related methods (like Body::CreateBodyFromSurfaces)
that construct a temporary body from trimmed surfaces. The first method
you need to call in this process is PartDoc::CreateNewBody, which arranges
for a place-holder for all the trimmed surfaces.
