# Body::AddPropertyExtension

This property is obsolete and has been superseded by
Body2::AddPropertyExtension2.

Description

This method stores a float, string, or integer value on a body. To do
this, you must first define the VARIANT type (float, string, or integer),
give your variable a value, and then call this method to place the value
on the body for future reference.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Body.AddPropertyExtension
( PropertyExtension)

| Input: | (VARIANT) PropertyExtension | Value you want to store on the body |
| Return: | (long) retval | Unique identifier returned to allow you to access the Property Extension in the future using Body::GetPropertyExtension |

Syntax (COM)

status = Body->AddPropertyExtension
( PropertyExtension, &retval )

| Input: | (VARIANT) PropertyExtension | Value you want to store on the body |
| Output: | (long) retval | Unique identifier returned to allow you to access the Property Extension in the future using Body::GetPropertyExtension |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

You should use the Attribute, AttributeDef, and Parameter objects instead
of this method. They are newer and provide more flexibility.
