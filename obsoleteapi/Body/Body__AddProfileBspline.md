# Body::AddProfileBspline

This method is obsolete and has been superseded by Body2::AddProfileBspline.

Description

This method creates an B-spline profile curve and returns a pointer
to that curve.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Body.AddProfileBspline ( props,
knots, ctrlPtCoords )

| Input: | (VARIANT) props | Contains 4 integers packed into 2 double elements (see below) |
| Input: | (VARIANT) knots | VARIANT of type SafeArray of numKnots doubles (see below) |
| Input: | (VARIANT) ctrlPtCoords | VARIANT of type SafeArray of numCtrlPtCoord doubles (see below) |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to dispatch object, the B-spline profile curve |

Syntax (COM)

status = Body->IAddProfileBsplineDLL
( props, knots, ctrlPtCoords, &retval )

| Input: | (long\*) props | Contains 4 longs (see below) |
| Input: | (double\*) knots | Pointer to an array of numKnots doubles (see below) |
| Input: | (double\*) ctrlPtCoords | Pointer to an array of numCtrlPtCoord doubles (see below) |
| Output: | (LPCURVE) retval | Pointer to the B-spline profile curve |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

You can use this method in conjunction with Body::CreateRevolutionSurface
to generate any surface of revolution, or with Body::CreateExtrusionSurface
to generate a tabulated cylinder.

The props argument contains the following values:

* DimensionControlPoints
* Order
* NumCtrlPoints
* Periodicity

The length of the knots array is given by:

numKnots = NumCtrlPoints + Order

The length of the CtrlPtCoords is given by:

numCtrlPtCoord = NumCtrlPoints \* DimensionControlPoints
