# Body::GetProcessedBody

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by Body2::GetProcessedBody2.

Description

This method pre-processes the geometry of a body so that:

* Closed periodic faces (for
  example, the lateral face of a cylinder) are split into two faces.
* Faces that straddle the
  seam, if any, of the underlying surface are split into two faces.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= Body.GetProcessedBody ( )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to Dispatch object, a body; this body is a copy of the body for this part, processed as previously described |

Syntax (COM)

status
= Body->IGetProcessedBody ( &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (LPBODY) retval | Pointer to the body; this body is a copy of the body for this part, processed as previously described |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Such pre-processing is sometimes necessary (for example, IGES), for
exporting into systems that have difficulty with periodic conditions.
