# Body::SetXform

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [Body2::SetXform](../Body2/Body2__ISetXform.htm).

Description

Use this method with the Body::GetIntersectionEdges method.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Body.SetXform ( xformIn )

| Input: | (VARIANT) xformIn | SafeArray of 16 doubles representing the transform (see Remarks) |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if the transform is set successfully, FALSE if not |

Syntax
(COM)

status = Body->ISetXform ( xformIn,
&retval )

| Input: | (double\*) xformIn | Pointer to an array of 16 doubles representing a transform (see Remarks) |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | TRUE if the transform is set successfully, FALSE if not |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

If there are two bodies in an assembly, then Body::GetIntersectionEdges
generates a list of the intersection edges between the two bodies. To
do this, the second body must be transformed in its coordinate space so
that it is in the same place with respect to the first body as it is in
assembly space.

To align the two bodies before calling Body::GetIntersectionEdges, calculate
the transformation from the first body to the second in the assembly and
set this as the transform for the second body using this method.

The xformIn argument contains a 16 element array defining the transform.
The first 9 are elements of 3x3 matrix, the next 3 define translation,
and the next 1 is scaling. The last 3 elements are unused. Specify the
transform in relation to the model.

Use this method with temporary body objects. If you call this method
on the actual part or component body object, you might corrupt your file.
You can use Body::Copy to make a copy of a body object.
