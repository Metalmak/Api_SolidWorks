# Body::CreateNewSurface

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by Body2::CreateNewSurface.

Description

This method creates a handle for a new surface to be used as geometry
for a face to be added to the body.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= Body.CreateNewSurface ()

| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to dispatch object, a new surface |

Syntax (COM)

status
= Body->ICreateNewSurface ( &retval )

| Output: | (LPSURFACE) retval | Pointer to the new surface |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method is the first in a set of related functions
that construct a body from trimmed surfaces.

Internally, this method also creates a list that
serves as a place-holder for trimming curves when trimming the surface.
