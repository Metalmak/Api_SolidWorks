# Body::CreateExtrusionSurface

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by Body2::CreateExtrusionSurface.

Description

This method creates a new extrusion surface (infinitely long tabulated
cylinder).

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Body.CreateExtrusionSurface
( profileCurve, axisDirection)

| Input: | (LPDISPATCH) profileCurve | Pointer to Dispatch object, the profile curve |
| Input: | (VARIANT) axisDirection | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z) |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to Dispatch object, a new surface of extrusion (tabulated cylinder) |

Syntax (COM)

status = Body->ICreateExtrusionSurfaceDLL(
profileCurve, axisDirection, &retval )

| Input: | (LPCURVE) profileCurve | Pointer to the profile curve |
| Input: | (double\*) axisDirection | Array of 3 doubles (x,y,z) |
| Output: | (LPSURFACE) retval | Pointer to the new surface of extrusion (tabulated cylinder) |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method is used with a set of related functions
that construct a body from trimmed surfaces.

The profileCurve argument is extruded along the
direction vector of axisDirection, the new surface being the envelope
of the curve. The profile curve must be a line, circle, or B-spline curve.

You can use this method with trimming curve creation
routines (for example, Surface::AddTrimmingLoop) to construct a trimmed
tabulated cylinder.
