# DrawingDoc::GetLineFontInfo

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by DrawingDoc::GetLineFontInfo2.

Description

This method gets the detailed information about the line font style,
including the line weight and segment lengths.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= DrawingDoc.GetLineFontInfo ( index)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) index | Index position of the line font |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT containing the line font style information |

Syntax (COM)

status
= DrawingDoc->GetLineFontInfo ( index, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) index | Index position of the Line font. |
| Output: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT containing the line font style information |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

You can use DrawingDoc::GetLineFontInfo2 to get
line font information.

Lines are repeating patterns of space and solid
segments. The segCount argument returns the number of segments that define
the pattern, and segLengths[] specifies the length of each segment. A
negative length value indicates space.

For example:

Solid line: segCount = 1, segLenghts[]
= {0.5}

Dashed line: segCount = 2, segLengths[]
= {0.25, -0.25}

VARIANT format:

double weight -
THIN = 0.0, NORMAL = 1.0, LW\_THICK = 2.0

double segCount -
Number of segments in the pattern

double segLengths[segCount] - Length of
each segment
