# DrawingDoc::CreateLinearDim

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [DrawingDoc::CreateLinearDim2](DrawingDoc__CreateLinearDim2.htm).

Description

This
method creates a non-associative linear dimension.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= DrawingDoc.CreateLinearDim ( p0, p1, p2, p3, p4, angle, arrowSize, text,
textHeight, witnessGap, witnessOvershoot)

| Input: | (VARIANT) p0 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z), dimension point |
| Input: | (VARIANT) p1 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z), dimension end |
| Input: | (VARIANT) p2 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z), normal to the plane of sketch |
| Input: | (VARIANT) p3 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z), extension line 1 reference point |
| Input: | (VARIANT) p4 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z), extension line 2 reference point |
| Input: | (double) angle | Inclination angle of the text in radians |
| Input: | (double) arrowSize | Arrow size meters |
| Input: | (BSTR) text | Dimension text string |
| Input: | (double) textHeight | Text height in meters |
| Input: | (double) witnessGap | Extension line gap in meters |
| Input: | (double) witnessOvershoot | Extension line overshoot in meters |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE for success, FALSE for failure |

Syntax (COM)

status

Text, TextHeight, WitnessGap, WitnessOvershoot )

| Input: | (double\*) P4 | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z), extension line 2 reference point |
| Input: | (double) Angle | Inclination angle of the text in radians |
| Input: | (double) ArrowSize | Arrow size meters |
| Input: | (BSTR) Text | Dimension text string |
| Input: | (double) TextHeight | Text height in meters |
| Input: | (double) WitnessGap | Extension gap in meters |
| Input: | (double) WitnessOvershoot | Extension overshoot in meters |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |
