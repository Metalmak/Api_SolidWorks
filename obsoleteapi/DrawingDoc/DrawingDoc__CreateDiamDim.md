# DrawingDoc::CreateDiamDim

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [DrawingDoc::CreateDiamDim2](DrawingDoc__CreateDiamDim2.htm).

Description

This
method creates a non-associative diameter dimension.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= DrawingDoc.CreateDiamDim ( dimVal, vP0, vP1, vP2, vP3, arrowSize, text,
textHeight, witnessGap, witnessOvershoot)

| Input: | (double) dimVal | Dimension value in meters |
| Input: | (VARIANT) vP0 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z), Location of text |
| Input: | (VARIANT) vP1 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z), Nearest point on circle |
| Input: | (VARIANT) vP2 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z), Farthest point on circle diametrically opposite to vP1 |
| Input: | (VARIANT) vP3 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z), Plane normal |
| Input: | (double) arrowSize | Arrow size in meters |
| Input: | (BSTR) text | Dimension text string |
| Input: | (double) textHeight | Text height in meters |
| Input: | (double) witnessGap | Extension gap in meters |
| Input: | (double) witnessOvershoot | Extension overshoot in meters |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if success, FALSE if not |

Syntax (COM)

status = DrawingDoc->ICreateDiamDim
( DimValue, P0, P1, P2, P3, ArrowSize, Text, TextHeight, WitnessGap, WitnessOvershoot
)

| Input: | (double) DimValue | Dimension value in meters |
| Input: | (double\*) P0 | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z), Location of text |
| Input: | (double\*) P1 | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z), Nearest point on circle |
| Input: | (double\*) P2 | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z), Farthest point on circle diametrically opposite to vP1 |
| Input: | (double\*) P3 | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z), Plane normal |
| Input: | (double) ArrowSize | Arrow size in meters |
| Input: | (BSTR) Text | Dimension text string |
| Input: | (double) TextHeight | Text height in meters |
| Input: | (double) WitnessGap | Extension gap in meters |
| Input: | (double) WitnessOvershoot | Extension overshoot in meters |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

SolidWorks creates this type of dimension between
the specified points. It has no relation to your geometry.
