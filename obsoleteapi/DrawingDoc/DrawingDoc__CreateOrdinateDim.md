# DrawingDoc::CreateOrdinateDim

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [DrawingDoc::CreateOrdinateDim2](DrawingDoc__CreateOrdinateDim2.htm).

Description

This
method creates a non-associative ordinate dimension.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= DrawingDoc.CreateOrdinateDim ( p0, p1, p2, p3, p4, angle, arrowSize,
text, textHeight, witnessGap, witnessOvershoot)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT) p0 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z), the dimension point |
| Input: | (VARIANT) p1 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z); this variable is a unit vector and specifies the direction of the ordinate dimension |
| Input: | (VARIANT) p2 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z), the extension line start point |
| Input: | (VARIANT) p3 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z), the extension line end point |
| Input: | (VARIANT) p4 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z); this variable is a unit vector and specifies the orientation of the text; for example, values (1, 0, 0) would result in horizontal text that is read from left to right |
| Input: | (double) angle | Inclination angle of the text in radians (character slant) |
| Input: | (double) arrowSize | Arrow size meters |
| Input: | (BSTR) text | Dimension text string |
| Input: | (double) textHeight | Text height in meters |
| Input: | (double) witnessGap | Extension line gap in meters |
| Input: | (double) witnessOvershoot | Extension line overshoot in meters |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE for success, FALSE for failure |

Syntax (COM)

status = DrawingDoc->ICreateOrdinateDim
( p0, p1, p2, p3, p4, angle, arrowSize, text, textHeight, witnessGap,
witnessOvershoot )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double\*) p0 | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z), the dimension point |
| Input: | (double\*) p1 | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z); this variable is a unit vector and specifies the direction of the ordinate dimension |
| Input: | (double\*) p2 | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z), the extension line start point |
| Input: | (double\*) p3 | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z), the extension line end point |
| Input: | (double\*) p4 | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z); this variable is a unit vector and specifies the orientation of the text; for example, values (1, 0, 0) would result in horizontal text that is read from left to right |
| Input: | (double) angle | Inclination angle of the text in radians (character slant) |
| Input: | (double) arrowSize | Arrow size meters |
| Input: | (BSTR) text | Dimension text string |
| Input: | (double) textHeight | Text height in meters |
| Input: | (double) witnessGap | Extension line gap in meters |
| Input: | (double) witnessOvershoot | Extension line overshoot in meters |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

SolidWorks creates this type of dimension between
the two specified points. It has no relation to your geometry.
