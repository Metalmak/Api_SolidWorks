# DrawingDoc::EditRebuild

This method is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::EditRebuild3.

Description

This method rebuilds the drawing.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void
DrawingDoc.EditRebuild ()

Syntax (COM)

status
= DrawingDoc->EditRebuild ( )

| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

There are certain situations in which SolidWorks blocks this command.
For example, if the user is interactively editing the properties of a
dimension, SolidWorks blocks this method because calling it invalidates
all of the pointers in the document. If DrawingDoc::EditRebuild is not
blocked, closing the Dimension-Properties
dialog box might cause problems because the dialog box looks for the original
dimension pointer.
