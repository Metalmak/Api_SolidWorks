# DrawingDoc::CreateBlockDefinition

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by SkethcManager::MakeSketchBlockFromFile,
SketchManager::MakeSketchBlockSelected,
and SketchManager::MakeSketchBlockFromSketch.

Description

This method creates a block definition from
the specified entities.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = DrawingDoc.CreateBlockDefinition ( Name,
XRefFileName, Instance, Segments, Points, Notes, Dimensions, Blocks )

| Input: | (BSTR) Name | Name of the block definition |
| Input: | (BSTR) XRefFileName | Name of the file that the block definition references |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) Instance | TRUE if the block instance should be created in the same place from the definition, FALSE if not |
| Input: | (VARIANT) Segments | VARIANT of type SafeArray of Dispatch objects of the sketch segments that should be part of the block definition |
| Input: | (VARIANT) Points | VARIANT of type SafeArray of Dispatch objects of the sketch points that should be part of the block definition |
| Input: | (VARIANT) Notes | VARIANT of type SafeArray of Dispatch objects of the notes that should be part of the block definition |
| Input: | (VARIANT) Dimensions | VARIANT of type SafeArray of Dispatch objects of the display dimensions that should be part of the block definition |
| Input: | (VARIANT) Blocks | VARIANT of type SafeArray of Dispatch objects of the block instances that should be part of the block definition |
| Output: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Dispatch pointer to the block definition |

Syntax (COM)

status = DrawingDoc->ICreateBlockDefinition (
Name, XRefFileName, Instance, SegmentCount, Segments, PointCount, Points,
NoteCount, Notes, DimensionCount, Dimensions, BlockCount, Blocks, &retval
)

| Input: | (BSTR) Name | Name of the block definition |
| Input: | (BSTR) XRefFileName | Name of the file that the block definition references |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) Instance | TRUE if the block instance should be created in the same place from this definition, FALSE if not |
| Input: | (long) SegmentCount | Number of sketch segments |
| Input: | (LPSKETCHSEGMENT\*) Segments | Array of sketch segments of size SegmentCount |
| Input: | (long) PointCount | Number of sketch points |
| Input: | (LPSKETCHPOINT\*) Points | Array of sketch points of size PointCount |
| Input: | (long) NoteCount | Number of notes |
| Input: | (LPNOTE\*) Notes | Array of notes of size NoteCount |
| Input: | (long) DimensionCount | Number of display dimensions |
| Input: | (LPDISPLAYDIMENSION\*) Dimensions | Array of display dimensions of size DimensionCount |
| Input: | (long) BlockCount | Number of block instances |
| Input: | (LPBLOCKINSTANCE\*) Blocks | Array of block instances of size BlockCount |
| Output: | (LPBLOCKDEFINITION) retval | Interface to the block definition |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The DrawingDoc::CreateBlockDefinition
method is similar to the DrawingDoc::MakeBlockDefinition method except
that instead of creating a block definition from the selected entities,
DrawingDoc::CreateBlockDefinition creates a block definition from the
specified entities.

If you have the pointers to
the entities for the block definition, running DrawingDoc::CreateBlockDefinition
should be faster than selecting all of the entities and then running DrawingDoc::MakeBlockDefinition
because of the time spent having to select the entities.

DrawingDoc::CreateBlockDefinition
deletes all of the entities that are input because these entities become
part of each block definition. To create a block instance from these entities,
exactly in the same place as the entities were before running DrawingDoc::CreateBlockDefinition,
set the Instance argument to TRUE.

Use the BlockDefinition::InsertInstance
method to create block instances of this definition.
