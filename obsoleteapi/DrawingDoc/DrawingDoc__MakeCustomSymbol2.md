# DrawingDoc::MakeCustomSymbol2

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [DrawingDoc::MakeBlockDefinition](DrawingDoc__MakeBlockDefinition.htm).

Description

This method makes a custom symbol from the
selected sketch entities without adding the custom symbol to the selection
list.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = DrawingDoc.MakeCustomSymbol2 ( )

| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Dispatch pointer to the newly created custom symbol |

Syntax (COM)

status = DrawingDoc->IMakeCustomSymbol2 ( &retval
)

| Output: | (LPCUSTOMSYMBOL) retval | Pointer to the newly created custom symbol |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method depends on something
being selected before it is called. If nothing is selected, SolidWorks
takes no action and returns NULL.
