# DrawingDoc::CreateSectionViewAt3

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by DrawingDoc::CreateSectionView4.

Description

This method creates a section
view at the specified location on the drawing.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = DrawingDoc.CreateSectionViewAt3 ( x, y,
z, notAligned, isOffsetSection, label, chgdirection, scwithmodel, partial,
dispsurfcut, excludedComponents)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) x | X position on the drawing sheet for the center of the drawing view |
| Input: | (double) y | Y position on the drawing sheet for the center of the drawing view |
| Input: | (double) z | Z position on the drawing sheet for the center of the drawing view |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) notAligned | TRUE breaks the alignment from the parent view, FALSE snaps into alignment with the parent view |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) isOffsetSection | TRUE creates an aligned section view (two lines at an angle), FALSE creates a normal projection section view |
| Input: | (BSTR) label | String containing the letter for the label for this section view |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) chgdirection | TRUE changes the direction of this section view, FALSE does not |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) scwithmodel | TRUE scales the section view with the model, FALSE does not |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) partial | TRUE displays a partial section view, FALSE does not |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) dispsurfcut | TRUE if only the surfaces cut by the section line are to appear in the section view, FALSE if not |
| Input: | (VARIANT) excludedComponents | Array of components to exclude from section view |
| Output: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to a Dispatch object, the newly created View object |

Remarks

Select the section line or the lines to use as
a section line before calling this method.

This method runs silently; the end-user is not
prompted for a label.

Use View::GetSection to get the DrSection object,
and use DrSection::SetLabel2 to set the name for the label, which provides
a warning if the name is a duplicate and the standard does not accept
duplicate names.
