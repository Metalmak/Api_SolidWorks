Syntax
(COM)

status = DrawingDoc->SetupSheet2
( name, paperSize, templateIn, scale1, scale2, skPointsFlag )

| Input: | (BSTR) name | Name for the sheet |
| Input: | (short) paperSize | Size of paper as defined in swDwgPaperSizes\_e |
| Input: | (short) templateIn | Template index as defined in swDwgTemplates\_e |
| Input: | (double) scale1 | Scale numerator |
| Input: | (double) scale2 | Scale denominator |

Remarks

You can also use Sheet::SetProperties,
Sheet::SetName and Sheet::SetTemplateName.

The templateIn value overrides paperSize
if they do not match.

The skPointsFlag is not available through
the SolidWorks user interface on a per-document level. This overrides
the global user option setting for the display of entity points.
