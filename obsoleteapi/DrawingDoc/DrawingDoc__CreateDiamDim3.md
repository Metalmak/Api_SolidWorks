# DrawingDoc::CreateDiamDim3

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by DrawingDoc::CreateDiamDim4.

Description

This
method creates a non-associative diameter dimension.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= DrawingDoc.CreateDiamDim3 ( dimVal, vP0, vP1, vP2, vP3, arrowSize, text,
textHeight, witnessGap, witnessOvershoot, vTextPoint )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) dimVal | Dimension value in meters |
| Input: | (VARIANT) vP0 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z), Location of text |
| Input: | (VARIANT) vP1 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z), Nearest point on circle |
| Input: | (VARIANT) vP2 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z), Farthest point on circle diametrically opposite to vP1 |
| Input: | (VARIANT) vP3 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z), Plane normal |
| Input: | (double) arrowSize | Arrow size in meters |
| Input: | (BSTR) text | Dimension text string |
| Input: | (double) textHeight | Text height in meters |
| Input: | (double) witnessGap | Extension gap in meters |
| Input: | (double) witnessOvershoot | Extension overshoot in meters |
| Input: | (VARIANT) vTextPoint | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z), Position of Text |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH)retval | Dispatch pointer for the display dimension created |

Syntax (COM)

Remarks

SolidWorks creates this type of dimension between
the specified points. It has no relation to your geometry.
