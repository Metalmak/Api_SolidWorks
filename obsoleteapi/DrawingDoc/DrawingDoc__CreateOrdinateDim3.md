# DrawingDoc::CreateOrdinateDim3

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by DrawingDoc::CreateOrdinateDim4.

Description

This method creates a non-associative ordinate dimension.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = DrawingDoc.CreateOrdinateDim3
( p0, p1, p2, p3, p4, angle, arrowSize, text, textHeight, witnessGap,
witnessOvershoot, p5 )

| Input: | (VARIANT) p0 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z), the dimension point. |
| Input: | (VARIANT) p1 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z); this variable is a unit vector and specifies the direction of the ordinate dimension |
| Input: | (VARIANT) p2 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z), the extension line start point. |
| Input: | (VARIANT) p3 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z), the extension line end point |
| Input: | (VARIANT) p4 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z); this variable is a unit vector and specifies the orientation of the text; for example, values (1, 0, 0) would result in horizontal text that is read from left to right |
| Input: | (double) angle | Inclination angle of the text in radians (character slant) |
| Input: | (double) arrowSize | Arrow size meters |
| Input: | (BSTR) text | Dimension text string |
| Input: | (double) textHeight | Text height in meters |
| Input: | (double) witnessGap | Extension gap in meters |
| Input: | (double) witnessOvershoot | Extension overshoot in meters |
| Input: | (VARIANT) p5 | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z), position of text |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH)retval | Dispatch pointer to DisplayDimension object |

Syntax (COM)

status = DrawingDoc->ICreateOrdinateDim3
( p0, p1, p2, p3, p4, angle, arrowSize, text, textHeight, witnessGap,
witnessOvershoot, p5, &retval )

| Input: | (double\*) p0 | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z), the dimension point. |
| Input: | (double\*) p1 | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z). This variable is a unit vector and specifies the direction of the ordinate dimension. |
| Input: | (double\*) p2 | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z), the extension line start point. |
| Input: | (double\*) p3 | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z), the extension line end point |
| Input: | (double\*) p4 | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z); this variable is a unit vector and specifies the orientation of the text; for example, values (1, 0, 0) would result in horizontal text that is read from left to right |
| Input: | (double) angle | Inclination angle of the text in radians (character slant) |
| Input: | (double) arrowSize | Arrow size meters |
| Input: | (BSTR) text | Dimension text string |
| Input: | (double) textHeight | Text height in meters |
| Input: | (double) witnessGap | Extension gap in meters |
| Input: | (double) witnessOvershoot | Extension overshoot in meters |
| Input: | (double) p5 | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z), position of text |
| Output: | (LPDISPLAYDIMENSION) retval | Pointer to DisplayDimension object |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful. |

Remarks

SolidWorks creates this type of dimension between
the two specified points. It has no relation to your geometry.
