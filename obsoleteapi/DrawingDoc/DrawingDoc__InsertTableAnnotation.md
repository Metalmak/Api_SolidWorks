# DrawingDoc::InsertTableAnnotation

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by DrawingDoc::InsertTableAnnotation2.

Description

This method inserts a table
annotation in this drawing.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = DrawingDoc.InsertTableAnnotation ( X, Y,
AnchorType, Rows, Columns)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) X | X coordinate at which to insert this table annotation |
| Input: | (double) Y | Y coordinate at which to insert this table annotation |
| Input: | (long) AnchorType | Type of anchor as defined by swBOMConfigurationAnchorType\_e (see Remarks) |
| Input: | (long) Rows | Number of rows in the table annotation |
| Input: | (long) Columns | Number of columns in the table annotation |
| Output: | (LPTABLEANNOTATION\*) retval | Pointer to the newly created TableAnnotation object |

#

Syntax (COM)

status = DrawingDoc->InsertTableAnnotation ( X,
Y, AnchorType, Rows, Columns, &retval)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) X | X coordinate at which to insert this table annotation |
| Input: | (double) Y | Y coordinate at which to insert this table annotation |
| Input: | (long) AnchorType | Type of anchor as defined by swBOMConfigurationAnchorType\_e (see Remarks) |
| Input: | (long) Rows | Number of rows in the table annotation |
| Input: | (long) Columns | Number of columns in the table annotation |
| Output: | (LPTABLEANNOTATION\*) retval | Pointer to the newly created TableAnnotation object |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

#

Remarks

The anchor helps to define
which corner is represented by the X and Y values. After the table is
inserted, the anchor does not mean anything in the context of the general
table. Because this method is used for general, BOM, and revision tables,
TableAnnotation::Anchored is only meaningful for the BOM and revision
tables.
