Remarks

This method places the center of the view at the
specified location.

The modelName must be an open document in the current
SolidWorks session. The viewName must exactly match the name of the model
view. For example, the names of the standard views begin with an asterisk.
This asterisk is part of the view name and must be included (for example,
"\*Front").
