# AttributeDef::CreateInstance4

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
byAttributeDef::CreateInstance5.

Description

This method creates an instance of this attribute
on a document, component, or an entity object.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = AttributeDef.CreateInstance4 ( ownerDoc,
ownerObj, nameIn, options, configurationOption )

| Input: | (LPMODELDOC2) ownerDoc | Document whose FeatureManager design tree to add this attribute |
| Input: | (LPDISPATCH) ownerObj | Component or entity to which to add this attribute:   * ENTITY, which can be a face, loop, edge, vertex,   or feature * COMPONENT2 * MODELDOC2 if NULL |
| Input: | (BSTR) nameIn | Name to be given to this attribute instance (see Remarks) |
| Input: | (long) options | Creation control options (see Remarks) |
| Input: | (long) configurationOption | Configuration options as defined in swInConfigurationOpts\_e |
| Output: | (LPATTRIBUTE) retval | Pointer to the newly created attribute instance |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Syntax (COM)

status = AttributeDef->ICreateInstance4 ( ownerDoc,
ownerComp, ownerEntity, nameIn, options, configurationOption, &retval
)

| Input: | (LPMODELDOC2) ownerDoc | Document whose FeatureManager design tree this attribute is to be added |
| Input: | (LPCOMPONENT2) ownerObj | Component to which to add this attribute:   * COMPONENT2 * MODELDOC2 if NULL |
| Input: | (LPENTITY) ownerEntity | Entity to which to add this attribute:   * face * loop * edge * vertex * feature |
| Input: | (BSTR) nameIn | Name to be given to this attribute instance (see Remarks) |
| Input: | (long) options | Creation control options (see Remarks) |
| Input: | (long) configurationOption | Configuration options as defined in swInConfigurationOpts\_e |
| Output: | (LPATTRIBUTE) retval | Pointer to the newly created attribute instance |

Remarks

When you add an attribute to a feature, the FeatureManager
design tree might not reflect the new state of the model. This discrepancy
exists for performance reasons (rebuilding the FeatureManager design tree
is very time-consuming). You can request a rebuild after you have added
a number of attributes to save time.

The attribute is created as a feature and displayed
in the FeatureManager design tree, which means that the name specified
in nameIn must be unique in the FeatureManager design tree for the document.

You can create attributes on entity objects such as faces and edges,
on features, or on the document itself.

Setting or clearing bits in the options argument controls the creation
of the attribute:

| Bit | Value | Meaning |
| 1 | 1 | Attribute is created hidden in the FeatureManager design tree (see Feature::SetUIState) |
| 1 | 0 | Attribute is created visible in the FeatureManager design tree |

For example, options = 1 creates an attribute that is hidden in the
FeatureManager design tree.

NOTE:
By default, SolidWorks adds attributes only to the active configuration.
SolidWorks adds the attribute to all other configurations as a suppressed
feature. You can unsuppress the attribute by selecting it with ModelDocExtension::SelectByID
and calling ModelDoc2::EditUnsuppressDependent2. If you want to add your
attributes to a non-active configuration, then the user must edit the
properties of that particular configuration and make sure that the Suppress New Features option is disabled.

Attributes are not supported on library features or library feature
parts. If you add an attribute to an entity, SolidWorks strips the attribute
feature from the entity if the entity is included in your export to a
library feature or library feature part. See the SolidWorks Help for more
information about library features.
