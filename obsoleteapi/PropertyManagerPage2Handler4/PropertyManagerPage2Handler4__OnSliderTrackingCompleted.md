# PropertyManagerPage2Handler4::OnSliderTrackingCompleted

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by PropertyManagerPage2Handler5::OnSliderTrackingCompleted.

Description

This method is called when
a user finishes dragging a slider control on this PropertyManager page.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void = PropertyManagerPage2Handler4.OnSliderTrackingCompleted
( Id, Value)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) Id | ID of slider control |
| Input: | (double) Value | Value indicating the new position of the slider |

#

Syntax (COM)

status = PropertyManagerPage2Handler4->OnSliderTrackingCompleted
( Id, Value)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) Id | ID of slider control |
| Input: | (double) Value | Value indicating the new position of the slider |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

#

Remarks

Although Value is declared
as a double, the value of a slider is always a long. When this method
is called, Value can be cast to a long.

If PropertyManagerPageSlider::Style
is set to swPropMgrPageSliderStyle\_NotifyWhileTracking, then you can use:

* PropertyManagerPage2Handler4::OnSliderTrackingCompleted
  to receive one notification when dragging of the slider is completed.

* PropertyManagerPage2Handler4::OnSliderPositionChanged
  to receive notifications every time the position of the slider changes
  because the slider is being dragged.

  NOTE: This might result in numerous calls to the handler, which
  is fine if the add-in responds quickly to each call. However, if the add-in
  responds slowly, then a performance bottleneck might occur.
