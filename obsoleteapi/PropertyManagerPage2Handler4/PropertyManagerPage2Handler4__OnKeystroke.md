This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by PropertyManagerPage2Handler5::OnKeystroke.

Description

This method processes a keystroke
that occurred on this PropertyManager page.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void = PropertyManagerPage2Handler4.OnKeystroke (
Wparam, Message, Lparam, Id)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) Wparam | wparam argument from Windows processing; indicates the keystroke that occurred    NOTE: From the standard set of virtual keys from Windows. Refer to the Virtual Key Code information from Microsoft documentation; for example, the Alt key is VK\_MENU. |
| Input: | (long) Message | Message being processed by Windows; one of these values:   * WM\_KEYDOWN   0x0100 * WM\_KEYUP   0x0101 * WM\_CHAR   0x0102 * WM\_DEADCHAR   0x0103 * WM\_SYSKEYDOWN   0x0104 * WM\_SYSKEYUP   0x0105 * WM\_SYSCHAR   0x0106 * WM\_SYSDEADCHAR   0x0107 |
| Input: | (long) Lparam | lparam argument from Windows processing; bitmask containing various pieces of information; dependent on specific message |
| Input: | (long) Id | ID of the control that has focus when the keystroke was made; this is the ID specified when the control was created in  PropertyManagerPage2:: AddControl or PropertyManagerPage2::AddGroupBox |

Remarks

After the add-in has finished
processing the keystroke, the message continues on and is processed by
Windows. Because processing must occur, nothing should be done to destroy
the page nor any action performed that could disrupt normal Windows processing
while the add-in is handling this keystroke.

To enable this functionality
for this PropertyManager page, set the Options argument of SldWorks::CreatePropertyManagerPage
to swPropertyManagerOptions\_HandleKeystrokes. By default, this style is
not enabled because most applications are not interested in processing
keystrokes, and it is a potential performance bottleneck if lots of keystrokes
are occurring.
