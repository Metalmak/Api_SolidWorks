Remarks

This method is only called
if callouts have been enabled for the selection box as indicated by the
Id argument. Use PropertyManagerPageSelectionbox::SetCalloutLabel to enable
callouts.

You can collect information
using this method. For example, you can get the selection type from the
last selection. Next, use the PropertyManagerPageSelectionbox::Callout
property to get the Callout object. Then, use the various Callout properties
to control the callout text and display characteristics based on that
selection information.

This method is a pre-notification.
