Remarks

The value of Id is the ID
that was specified when the tab was created by PropertyManagerPage2::AddTab.

When a user clicks a tab,
control is passed to the add-in via this method. The add-in is expected
to show or hide groups and controls intended to be visible or hidden on
that tab.

Your add-in is responsible
for showing and hiding the controls on a tab to simulate moving between
tabs, making it look like the tab is a container for the controls. However,
tabs are not containers for the groups or controls. Tabs are controls
that are displayed in a certain way, making them look like control containers.
