Remarks

This handler method is called
when the PropertyManager page is about to close.

SolidWorks controls when add-ins
can do work. An add-in is unable to do any real work within the PropertyManager2Handler::OnClose
handler because the PropertyManager page and command are closing. So,
typically the PropertyPage2Handler4::AfterClose handler is called after
PropertyManager2Handler4::OnClose to allow an add-in to do work. However:

| If PropertyManager page is... | And you implemented the handler in... | Then you... |
| Not pinned | C++ | Can prevent the PropertyManager page from closing by setting the HRESULT return value to S\_FALSE. |
|  | Visual Basic | Should use the Err.Raise method with a value of 1 to prevent the PropertyManager page from closing. In VB.NET, use 0 with Err.Raise. |
|  | NOTE:  When control returns to SolidWorks:   * The   PropertyManager page remains displayed on the screen. * The   PropertyManagerPage2Handler4::AfterClose handler is not called. | |
| Pinned | C++ or Visual Basic | Set HRESULT to S\_FALSE to close the PropertyManager page (i.e., ignore the fact that the page is pinned).  This allows your add-in to call the PropertyManagerPage2Handler4::AfterClose handler and do its work. To avoid aggravating your user, who expected the PropertyManager page  to remain pinned, you should re-display and re-pin the PropertyManager page after the add-in finishes its work. |

NOTE:
In the previous version of this method, PropertyManagerPage2Handler3::OnClose,
if the user clicked the Cancel button and the PropertyManager page had
a pushpin, then this method returned swPropertyManagerPageClose\_Closed.
This version of this method returns swPropertyManagerPageClose\_Cancel
in this scenario.
