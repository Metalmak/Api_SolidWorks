# FileSaveAsNotify - PartDoc Event

This event is obsolete and has been superseded
by PartDoc event FileSaveAsNotify2.

Description

Pre-notifies the user program
when a file is about to be saved with a new name and passes the new document
name.

status = FileSaveAsNotify ( FileName )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BSTR) FileName | Name of the saved file |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

#

Remarks

You should check the filename
extension of the FileName value passed to your application because the
user may be saving this document as IGES, DSF, and so on.

When a user selects File, Save on a document that has never
been saved, you receive a FileSaveAsNotify instead of FileSaveNotify.

Return S\_FALSE to stop from proceeding
with the action that caused the notification.
