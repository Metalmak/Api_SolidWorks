# Face::SetFaceId

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by Face2::SetFaceId.

Description

This method sets the face ID on an imported body.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

(void)
Face.SetFaceId (int idIn)

| Input: | (int) idIn | Face ID |

Syntax (COM)

status
= Face-> SetFaceId ( idIn)

| Input: | (int) idIn | Face ID |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

SolidWorks uses this ID to track the specific faces
of imported bodies (for example, IGES imports).

The face ID is a persistent and is saved with the
document. The face ID can be changed by any third party application. The
intent is that you assign an ID to a particular face so that you can refer
to that face within your application. Each ID must be unique, so it is
best to let SolidWorks assign IDs for you when an imported body or surface
is created.

To store data
with a face, use the Attribute object.
