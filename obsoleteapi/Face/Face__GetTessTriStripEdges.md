# Face::GetTessTriStripEdges

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by Face2::GetTessTriStripEdges.

Description

This method
gives the edge ID for each of the edges in the triangles that make
up the tessellation for this face.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Face.GetTessTriStripEdges ( )

| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray of type long containing the list of edge IDs for this face |

Syntax (COM)

status = Face->IGetTessTriStripEdges (retval )

| Output: | (long\*) retval | Pointer to an array of type long containing the list of edge IDs for this face |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

A zero value for edge ID indicates that there is no corresponding model
edge.

The format of the returned data is:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| DWORD NumStrips | Number of strips on a particular face. |
| DWORD [StripLengths] | Array containing the number from 0 to (NumStrips-1) of vertex points on particular face strip. |
| ForEach Strip | Array of edge IDs for each vertex on the particular face strip. |
| Long [EdgeIds] | Array of edge IDs for each strip from 1 to (VertexPerStrip-1). Element 0 indicates if it is a triangle strip (value = 1) or a single triangle (value = 0). |

For triangle strips, EdgeIds is:

If the strip has n vertices, then there
is 2(n – 2) + 1 edge tags. The i-th element of the tags array (starting
at i = 1) is the tag of the edge between vertex floor((i – 1) / 2) + 1
and vertex floor(i/2) + 2, where floor(x) is the integer portion of x.

For single triangles, EdgeIds is:

The i-th element of the tags array (starting
at i = 1) is the tag of the edge between vertex i-1 (if i=1 then i=n)
and vertex i.
