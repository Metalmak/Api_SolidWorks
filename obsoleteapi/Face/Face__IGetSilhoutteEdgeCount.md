status
= Face->IGetSilhoutteEdgeCount ( root, normal, &ret )

| Input: | (double\*) root | Array of doubles defining the root point |
| Input: | (double\*) normal | Array of doubles defining the direction vector |
| Output: | (long) ret | Number of silhouette edges |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

For a given vector root point (root) and
a vector direction (normal), this method calculates the number of edges
that returned by [Face::IGetSilhoutteEdges](Face__GetSilhoutteEdges.htm).

The siledgesout array returned by [Face::IGetSilhoutteEdges](Face__GetSilhoutteEdges.htm) contains
two elements for each edge: the silhouette edge and an unused parameter.
To allocate data to hold the returned information, allocate double the
elements returned by this method.
