# Face::GetTessTriangles

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by Face2::GetTessTriangles.

Description

This method returns the triangles that make up the shaded picture tessellation
for this face.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= Face.GetTessTriangles ( noConversion)

| Input: | (BOOL) noConversion | TRUE prohibits conversion to user units from system units, FALSE does not |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray (see below) |

Syntax (COM)

status = Face->IGetTessTriangles
( noConversion, retval )

| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) noConversion | TRUE prohibits conversion to user units from system units, FALSE does not |
| Output: | (float\*) retval | Pointer to array of floats (see below) |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

These triangles are intended for graphics display purposes and do not
represent a tessellation that can be used, for example, by a machining
application. If you need the level of accuracy associated with a machining
product, traverse the body faces and extract the topology and geometry
data to create your own faceting.

The format of the returned data is:

float x, y, z - first point in meters

float x, y, z - second point in meters

float x, y, z - third point in meters

where this data repeats itself for the
set of triangles on this face.

The total size of the data is
[ 9 x sizeof(float ) x (number of triangles) ].
