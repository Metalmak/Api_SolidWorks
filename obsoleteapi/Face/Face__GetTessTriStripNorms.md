# Face::GetTessTriStripNorms

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by Face2::GetTessTriStripNorms.

Description

This method
gives the normal vector for each of the triangles which make up
the shaded picture tessellation for this face.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Face.GetTessTriStripNorms
()

| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray containing the tristrip normals |

Syntax (COM)

status = Face->IGetTessTriStripNorms
( retval )

| Output: | (float\*) retval | Pointer to an array of floats (see below) |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The format of the return data is:

DWORD NumStrips

DWORD [VertexPerStrip] where this is an
array from 0 to (Numstrips-1)

Float [Normals ] where this is an array
of X,Y,Z normal components for each strip from 0 to (VertexPerStrip-1)

where:

NumStrips = number of strips on a particular
face

VertexPerStrip = an array containing
the number of vertex points on particular face strip

NormalComp = an array of X,Y,Z normal
components for each vertex on the particular face strip
