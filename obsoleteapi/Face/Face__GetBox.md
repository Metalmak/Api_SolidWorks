Remarks

The X,Y,Z points returned are the lower and upper diagonal corners that
bound the face with the box sides parallel to the X, Y and Z axes. The
box dimensions returned enclose the face and are typically close to the
minimum possible size, but not always.

The return value is an array of doubles as follows:

[ XCorner1, YCorner1, ZCorner1, XCorner2,
YCorner2, ZCorner2 ]
