Description

This method
gets the shell type (open, internal, external) for this face.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Face.GetShellType ( )

| Return: | (int) retval | Shell type:  0 = An open shell. For example, a face belonging to a sheet body or reference surface.  1 = An internal shell. For example, a face which belongs to a cavity.
