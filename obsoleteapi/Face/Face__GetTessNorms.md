# Face::GetTessNorms

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by Face2::GetTessNorms.

Description

This method returns
the normal vector for each of the triangles that make up the shaded picture
tessellation.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Face.GetTessNorms ()

| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray (see below) |

Syntax
(COM)

status = Face->IGetTessNorms ( retval
)

| Output: | (float\*) retval | Pointer to an array of floats (see below) |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The return value for this method is in
the format:

float x, y, z - first point unit normal

float x, y, z - second point unit normal

float x, y, z - third point unit normal

where this data repeats itself for the set of triangles
on this face.

The total size of the data is [
9 x sizeof(float) x (number of triangles) ].
