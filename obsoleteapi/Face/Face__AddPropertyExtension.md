# Face::AddPropertyExtension

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by Face2::AddPropertyExtension.

Description

This method allows you to store a float, string, or integer value on
a face. To do this, you must first define the VARIANT type (float, string,
or integer), give your variable a value, and then call this method to
place the value on the face for future reference.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Face.AddPropertyExtension
( PropertyExtension)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT) PropertyExtension | Value you want to store on the face |
| Return: | (long) retval | Unique identifier returned to allow you to access the property extension |

Syntax
(COM)

status
= Face->AddPropertyExtension ( PropertyExtension, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT) PropertyExtension | Value you want to store on the face |
| Output: | (long\*) retval | Unique identifier returned to allow you to access the property extension |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Use the Attribute, AttributeDef, and Parameter classes instead of this
method. These classes are newer and provide more flexibility.

Please note that this method is currently unsupported for faces obtained
from reference surface bodies.
