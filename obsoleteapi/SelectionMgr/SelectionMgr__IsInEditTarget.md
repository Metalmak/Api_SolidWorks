# SelectionMgr::IsInEditTarget

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by SelectionMgr::IsInEditTarget2.

Description

This method determines if the selected object is in the edit target.
This is necessary in assemblies when the end-user performs in-context
editing of a part. This method allows you to determine if a selected item
belongs to the model that is the current edit target.

| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if the selected item specified by AtIndex belongs to a model which is the current edit target, FALSE if not |

Syntax (COM)
