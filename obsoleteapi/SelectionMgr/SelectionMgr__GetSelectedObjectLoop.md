# SelectionMgr::GetSelectedObjectLoop

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by SelectionMgr::GetSelectedObjectLoop2.

Description

This method gets the loop,
if selected, for the selected edge.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = SelectionMgr.GetSelectedObjectLoop ( AtIndex)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) AtIndex | Index position within the current list of selected items, where AtIndex ranges from 1 to SelectionMgr::GetSelectedObjectCount |
| Output: | (LPLOOP2) retval | Pointer to the Loop2 object |

#

Syntax (COM)

status = SelectionMgr->GetSelectedObjectLoop (
AtIndex, &retval)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) AtIndex | Index position within the current list of selected items, where AtIndex ranges from 1 to SelectionMgr::GetSelectedObjectCount |
| Output: | (LPLOOP2) retval | Pointer to the Loop2 object |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

#

Remarks

If a loop is not associated with an edge, then
this method returns NULL.

NOTE: Use
this method to find out if the selected edge has an associated loop. ModelDoc2::SelectLoop
does not add an item to the SelectionMgr.
