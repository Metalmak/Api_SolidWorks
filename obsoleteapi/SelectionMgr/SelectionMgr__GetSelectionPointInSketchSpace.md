# SelectionMgr::GetSelectionPointInSketchSpace

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by SelectionMgr::GetSelectionPointInSketchSpace2.

Description

This method gets the selection point projected onto the active sketch
and returned in sketch space. The selection point is projected onto the
currently active sketch, resulting in a Z value, which is always 0.00.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = SelectionMgr.GetSelectionPointInSketchSpace
( AtIndex)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) AtIndex | Index position within the current list of selected items where AtIndex ranges from 1 to SelectionMgr::GetSelectedObjectCount |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z) |

Syntax (COM)

status = SelectionMgr->IGetSelectionPointInSketchSpace
( AtIndex, retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) AtIndex | Index position within the current list of selected items where AtIndex ranges from 1 to SelectionMgr::GetSelectedObjectCount |
| Output: | (double\*) retval | Pointer to an array of doubles, the X,Y,Z selection point |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

If a sketch is not currently active, then the return value is the same
as that returned by SelectionMgr::GetSelectionPoint.
You can determine if a sketch is active by checking for a NULL return
value from ModelDoc2::GetActiveSketch2. In Visual Basic, check for Nothing.
For example:

If (Part.GetActiveSketch
Is Nothing) Then

swApp.SendMsgToUser "No
Active sketch" ' No sketch is active

End If
