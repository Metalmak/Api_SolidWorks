# ChamferFeatureData::SetVertexChamferDistance

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by ChamferFeatureData2::SetVertexChamferDistance.

Description

This method sets the vertex chamfer distance.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ChamferFeatureData.SetVertexChamferDistance
( side, distance )

| Input: | (int) side | Feature direction, set to a value between 0 and 1 |
| Input: | (double) distance | vertex chamfer distance |

Syntax (COM)

status = ChamferFeatureData ->SetVertexChamferDistance
( side, distance )

| Input: | (int) side | Feature direction, set to a value between 0 and 1 |
| Input: | (double) distance | Vertex chamfer distance |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Relevant only for vertex-type chamfers. Currently, only vertex chamfers
with three edges are supported.
