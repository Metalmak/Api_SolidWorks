# ModelDocExtension::GetSectionProperties

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by ModelDocExtension::GetSectionProperties2.

Description

This method gets the section properties for
the following types of selected items:

* Planar
  model face in any document
* Face
  on a section plane
* Crosshatch
  section face in a section view in a drawing a sketch
* Sketch

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDocExtension.GetSectionProperties (
sections )

#

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT) sections | Array of sections |
| Output: | (VARIANT) \* retval | SafeArray of section properties for the selected items |

#

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDocExtension->IGetSectionProperties
( count, sections, retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) count | Number of sections |
| Input: | (LPUNKNOWN) \*sections | Array of sections of size count |
| Output: | (double) \* retval | Array of size 15 of the section properties for the selected items (see Remarks) |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

#

Remarks

This method clears the selection set.

| If... | Then... |
| The user selected a set of either parallel planes or parallel faces | You can pass an empty sections array |
| The user selected any items and you pass a sections array | The properties of the user-selected items and the sections array are combined in retval |
| You pass a sections array and you do not want this array combined with the properties of any user-selected items | Clear any user-selected items |

The objects in the sections parameter are added
to the current selection set. If the objects are already in the current
selection set, an error is generated; that is, status code will be equal
to 1, which means invalid input.

The format of retval is an
array of size 15:

| * retval[0] | status of request:   * 0   = success * 1   = invalid input * 2   = selected faces are not in the same or parallel planes * 3   = unable to compute section properties |
| * retval[1] | area |
| * retval[2] | centroid x |
| * retval[3] | centroid y |
| * retval[4] | centroid z |
| * retval[5] | moment of inertia XX |
| * reval[6] | moment of inertia YY |
| * retval[7] | moment of inertia ZZ |
| * retval[8] | moment of inertia -XY |
| * retval[9] | moment of inertia -ZX |
| * retval[10] | moment of inertia -YZ |
| * retval[11] | polar moment of inertia of an area at the centroid |
| * retval[12] | angle between principal axis and part axis |
| * retval[13] | principal moment of inertia of an area at the centroid, 1x |
| * retval[14] | principal moment of inertia of an area at the centroid, 1y |

This method returns metric
units unless explicitly specified otherwise.
