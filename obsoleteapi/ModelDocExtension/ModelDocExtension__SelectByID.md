# ModelDocExtension::SelectByID

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by ModelDocExtension::SelectByID2.

Description

This method selects the specified
entity.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDocExtension.SelectByID ( Name, Type,
X, Y, Z, Append, Mark, Callout )

Remarks

Use this method instead of using the selection
methods on the following objects:

* Annotation
* Component2
* Feature
* FeatureManager
* SketchHatch
* SketchPoint
* SketchSegment

The previously listed objects' selection methods
do not work well when a PropertyManager page is open or a command is running.
This method, ModelDocExtension::SelectByID, handles selection correctly
whether or not a command is running.

If your application already has an object handle
(for example, Face, SketchSegment, and so on), use the appropriate Select
method to select the item directly using its handle.

To filter the objects selected by this method,
set the Type argument. If no filtering is required, then pass an empty
string for this argument.

For example, to select an object of type swSelDIMENSIONS,
use the string that appears in the comment column, "DIMENSION".
The objectType might change based on your current state. For example,
to select a sketch point that was created in the active sketch, specify
the Type "SKETCHPOINT". However, if you do not have an active
sketch, or if the point was created in a sketch other than the active
sketch, then specify the Type "EXTSKETCHPOINT".

If a type is specified in Type, then this method
returns FALSE if it cannot find the matching object type.

The Name argument is not intended for selection
of faces, edges, and so on. This is a case-sensitive string for objects
that are automatically named by SolidWorks during entity creation, such
as dimensions, drawing views, and so on. This method tries to find and
select an object whose name matches the Name argument; however, the match
needs to be exact for this method to return TRUE.

For example, if a string is passed that matches
an object name but whose case does not match exactly, this method might
return FALSE. For selection of dimensions, the Name argument needs to
be fully qualified. For example, specify "D1@Sketch2@Part1.SLDPRT"
rather than simply "D1@Sketch2"; otherwise, this method might
return FALSE. If you do not know the object name, or if it is an item
that is not automatically named by SolidWorks, you can pass an empty string.

If you are using the Name parameter, then specify
the XYZ coordinates in terms of the context where the item was created.
For example, if you want to select a sketch point using its name (for
example, "Point1") in the Name argument, then specify XYZ in
terms of the sketch where the point was created. Even if the sketch is
not active, specify the XYZ values in terms of sketch space when you use
the Name parameter. In certain situations, you can also pass in the XYZ
coordinates as simply ( 0,0,0 ). For example, to select a feature shown
in the FeatureManager design tree, you do not need to specify an XYZ coordinates.
However, to select objects such as Notes or Faces, or when you need a
point location picked, you must specify the XYZ coordinates.

If you are not using the Name parameter as a filter,
then specify the XYZ coordinates in terms of model space.

If you do not know the object name or the object
type, pass in empty strings for the Name and Type parameters and the selection
routine makes the best attempt to select the correct object.

To get Face, Edge or Vertex objects by name, use
PartDoc::GetEntityByName.

The ModelDoc object used to call this method must
be an open and visible document. For example, you cannot use the ModelDoc
object returned from an assembly component (Component2::GetModelDoc) unless
that SolidWorks component part or subassembly is an open and visible document.
In this case, you can select the item using the fully-qualified name (for
example, "Plane4@Part1-1@Assem1").

When selecting Face objects, this method uses the
specified point as input to the normal UI selection routines to use the
speed of ray tracing. As a result, if the view changes from the original
recorded size or orientation, then the same Face might not be selected
next time. If your application has a pointer to the Face object to be
selected, then you can call the Entity::Select3 method directly. Otherwise,
you can call ModelDoc2::SelectByRay. Calling ModelDoc2::SelectByRay allows
for tighter control over the starting point and the direction in which
to search.
