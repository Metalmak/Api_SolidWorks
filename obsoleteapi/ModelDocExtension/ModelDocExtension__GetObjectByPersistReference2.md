# ModelDocExtension::GetObjectByPersistReference2

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by ModelDocExtension::GetObjectByPersistReference3.

Description

This method gets the object
assigned to the specified persistent reference ID.

NOTE:
A persistent reference ID is related to a model. It is portable and can
be saved within the model or in other places. Some persistent reference
IDs are general to all models and can be instantiated from all models.
Your application must handle persistent reference IDs and their relationships
among models.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

\*dispObj = ModelDocExtension.GetObjectByPersistReference2
( persistId, \*errorCode)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT) persistId | Object's persistent reference ID (see Remarks) |
| Output: | (long ) \*errorCode | Success or error code as defined by swPersistReferencedObjectStates\_e (see Remarks) |
| Output: | (LPDISPATCH ) \*dispObj | Dispatch pointer to the object |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDocExtension->IGetObjectByPersistReference2
( count, \*persistId, \*errorCode, &dispObj)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) count | Size of persistent reference ID (see Remarks) |
| Input: | (BYTE ) \*persistId | Persistent reference ID (see Remarks) |
| Output: | (long ) \*errorCode | Success or error code as defined by swPersistReferencedObjectStates\_e (see Remarks) |
| Output: | (LPDISPATCH ) \*dispObj | Dispatch pointer to the object |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Before calling this method:

1. If
   using the COM version of this method, call ModelDocExtension::GetPersistentReferenceCount
   to determine the size of the persistent reference ID.
2. Call
   ModelDocExtension::GetPersistReference to get the object's persistent
   reference ID.

The swPersistReferencedObject\_Suppressed
and swPersistReferencedObject\_Deleted
enumerators only apply to references of topological entities.
