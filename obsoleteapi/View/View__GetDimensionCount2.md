Remarks

This method is identical to the now obsolete View::GetDimensionCount
except when a base ordinate is not visible, the subordinates were not
output, regardless if they are visible or not.

With this method, the output of each subordinate, if it is visible,
occurs regardless if its base ordinate is visible.
