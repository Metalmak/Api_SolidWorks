Remarks

A SolidWorks dimension can be displayed more than once. For example,
the base-extrude dimension could be brought into three different views
on a drawing. These three dimensions are referred to as display dimensions
and are represented by the DisplayDimension object in the SolidWorks API.
The original base-extrude dimension is represented by the Dimension object
in the SolidWorks API.

This method includes suppressed dimensions.
