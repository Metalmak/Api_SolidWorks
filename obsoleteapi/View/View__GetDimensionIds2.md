# View::GetDimensionIds2

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [View::GetDimensionIds3](View__GetDimensionIds3.htm).

Description

This method returns a list of dimension names from the current drawing
view.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = View.GetDimensionIds2 ()

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray of strings; each string represents one dimension name from the current drawing view |

Syntax (COM)

status = View->IGetDimensionIds2
( &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (BSTR) retval | Array of strings; each string represents one dimension name from the current drawing view |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The order of the dimension names returned aligns with the order of information
returned from View::GetDimensionInfo4. This alignment of information is
valid as long as the calls to this method and View::GetDimensionInfo4
are made consecutively.

One string is returned for each dimension in the view. See [View::GetDimensionCount2](View__GetDimensionCount2.htm)
to determine the number of dimensions in the view.

This method is identical to View::GetDimensionIds except when a base
ordinate was not visible, the subordinates were not previously output,
regardless of whether they were visible or not. With View::GetDimensionIds2,
the output of each subordinate, if it is visible, occurs regardless of
whether or not its base ordinate is visible.
