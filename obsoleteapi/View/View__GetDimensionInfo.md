# View::GetDimensionInfo

This method is obsolete and has been superseded by
[View::GetDimensionInfo2](View__GetDimensionInfo2.htm).

Description

This method returns information about the dimension. All values returned
are in meters.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = View.GetDimensionInfo ()

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray containing the dimension information |

Syntax (COM)

status = View->IGetDimensionInfo
(retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (double\*) retval | Pointer to an array of doubles containing the dimension information |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

For COM implementation, see View::GetDimensionCount to determine the
overall size of the array needed. The maximum number of doubles contained
in the array will be (1 + dimensionCount
\* 46).

The data returned is an array of doubles as follows:

[
dimensionCount, [ dimensionType,
lineStyle, refPoint1a[3], refPoint1b[3], refPoint2a[3],
refPoint2b[3], refPoint3[3], textPoint[3],
textDirection[3], dimNormal[3], angularDimInfo[9],
precision, arrowLength, arrowHeadWidth, arrowHeadHeight, arrowHeadStyle,
witnessGap, witnessExt, dimValue, textHeight, arrowsOut, isDiameter ] ]

where:

dimensionCount
 = the number of dimensions found in the drawing view

For
each dimension, we have a repeating set of the following data:

dimensionType =
returns 0 = Linear, 1 = Angular, 2 = Radial, 3 = Ordinate

lineStyle =
line style (Dimension Style = 5)

refPoint1a[3]  = array of three doubles.

refPoint1b[3]  = array of three doubles.

refPoint2a[3]  = array of three doubles.

refPoint2b[3]  = array of three doubles.

refPoint3[3]  = array of three doubles.

textPoint[3]  = array of three doubles. This
is the upper-left corner of the dimension bounding box.

textDirection[3]  = an array of three doubles

dimNormal[3] = an array of three doubles

angularDimInfo[9]
= data is only returned for angular dimensions. The array of 9 values
is as follows:

quadrant
 = as defined in swQuadant\_e.

directionLine1[3] =
array of three doubles.

directionLine2[3] =
array of three doubles.

isInteriorAngle =
BOOLEAN returned as a double. TRUE if it is an interior angle.

isFlipped
 = a boolean returned as a double. TRUE if it is flipped.

precision =
number of decimal places.

arrowLength =
arrow length.

arrowHeadWidth =
arrowhead width.

arrowHeadHeight =
arrowhead height.

arrowHeadStyle =
arrowhead style as defined in swArrowStyle\_e.

witnessGap =
extension gap.

witnessExt =
extension's extension.

dimValue =
dimension value.

textHeight =
dimension text height.

arrowsOut
 = BOOLEAN returned as a double and is TRUE if the arrows are outside.

isDiameter
 = BOOLEAN returned as a double and is used by radial dimensions.
If this value is TRUE, then the dimValue
returned is the diameter value; if FALSE, then the dimValue
returned is the radial value.
