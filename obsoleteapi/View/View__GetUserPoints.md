# View::GetUserPoints

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by View::GetUserPoints2.

Description

This method returns all of the user points in this drawing view.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = View.GetUserPoints ()

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray |

Syntax (COM)

status = View->IGetUserPoints (
&retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (double) retval | Pointer to an array of doubles |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The return value is the following array of doubles:

[
[ X,
Y, Z ], .. ]

 size = Number of Points \* 3

This set of data repeats itself for each user point in the view. The
size of the array is (NumPts \* 3). To determine the number of points in
the view, see View::GetUserPointsCount.

The data returned from this method is in terms of view space. If you
want the data in terms of sheet space (that is, - the 0,0 origin being
the lower-left corner of the sheet), then combine this data with the three
return values from View::GetXForm.
