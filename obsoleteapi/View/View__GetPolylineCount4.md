| Drawing is already open | All polylines in the drawing are generated. If you open a drawing that is zoomed in to a particular region, then the polylines that are outside the zoomed region do not exist if the parts or assemblies shown in this drawing have been changed. To force the generation of all possible polyline data, call ModelDoc2::ViewZoomtofit. |
