# View::GetArcs2

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [View::GetArcs3](View__GetArcs3.htm).

Description

This method returns information for each arc that was sketched in this
drawing view.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = View.GetArcs2 ()

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray containing an array of doubles |

Syntax (COM)

status = View->IGetArcs2 ( retval
)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (double\*) retval | Pointer to an array of doubles as |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method returns arcs that have been deliberately sketched in this
drawing view. All part and assembly geometry shown in a drawing view is
represented by polylines. To access the polylines, use View::GetPolylines3.

Return value is an array of doubles with the format:

[
LineType, StartPt[3], EndPt[3], CenterPt[3],
RotDir, ... ]

where:

LineType the
line type. Valid returns are found in the swLineTypes\_e enumeration. A
lineType is a combination of a lineStyle and lineWeight.

StartPt[3] an
array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the start point.

EndPt[3] an
array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the end point. If the arc is closed,
then this is the same point as the StartPt.

CenterPt[3] an
array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the center point.

RotDir the
rotational direction (CW = -1, CCW = 1)

...

This set of data repeats for each arc in the view. The size of the array
is (NumArcs \* 11). To determine the number of arcs, use View::GetArcCount.

The data returned from this method is in terms of view space. If you
want the data in terms of sheet space (for example, the 0,0 origin being
the lower-left corner of the sheet), then you combine this data with the
three return values from View::GetXForm.
