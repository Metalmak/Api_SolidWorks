# View::GetDimensionDisplayString3

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by View::GetDimensionDisplayString4.

Description

This method gets all of the dimension strings in the current drawing
view.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = View.GetDimensionDisplayString3
()

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray of strings containing the dimension text |

Syntax (COM)

status = View->IGetDimensionDisplayString3
( retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (BSTR\*) retval | Array of strings containing the dimension text |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

For each dimension in the drawing view, this method returns 10 strings.
If any of the dimension strings are not used, then those strings are returned
as NULL strings.

[ value1, tolMax1 tolMin1, value2, tolMax2,
tolMin2, prefix, suffix, callout1, callout2 ]

This set of data is returned for each dimension in the view. See View::GetDimensionCount3
to determine the number of dimensions in the view.

This method is identical to the now obsolete View::GetDimensionDisplayString2
except a dangling dimension was not output by that method. This version
of this method outputs dangling dimensions.
