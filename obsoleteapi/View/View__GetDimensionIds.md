# View::GetDimensionIds

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [View::GetDimensionIds2](View__GetDimensionIds2.htm).

Description

This method returns a list of dimension names from the current drawing
view.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = View.GetDimensionIds ()

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray of strings; each string in the array represents one dimension name from the current drawing view |

Syntax (COM)

status = View->IGetDimensionIds
( &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (BSTR) retval | Array of strings; each string in the array represents one dimension name from the current drawing view |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The order of the dimension names returned aligns with the order of information
returned from View::GetDimensionInfo. This alignment of information is
valid as long as the calls to this method  and
View::GetDimensionInfo are made consecutively.

One string is returned for each dimension in the view. See View::GetDimensionCount
to determine the number of dimensions in the view.
