# View::GetParabolas

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by View::GetParabolas2.

Description

This method gets all of the
parabolas in the view.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = View.GetParabolas ( )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray |

Syntax (COM)

status = View->IGetParabolas ( &retval
)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (double) retval | pointer to an array of doubles |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The return values are in an array of doubles:

[ Color, LineType, LineStyleIndex, LineWeight,
StartPt[3], EndPt[3], FocusPt[3], ApexPt[3] ...
]

where:

Color = COLORREF returned as an integer.
Return value could be 0 or -1 for default color.

LineType = line type. Valid returns
as defined in swLineTypes\_e. A lineType
is a combination of a lineStyle and lineWeight.

LineStyleIndex = index location of this
line style inside SolidWorks Line Style Manager.

LineWeight = integer value defining
the line weight.

StartPt[3] = array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z)
describing the parabola start point.

EndPt[3] = array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z)
describing the parabola end point.

FocusPt[3] = array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z)
describing the parabola focus Point.

ApexPt[3] = array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z)
describing the parabola apex Point.

This set of data repeats for each parabola in the view. The size of
the array is (NumParabolas \* 16). To determine the number of parabolas,
use View::GetParabolaCount.
