# View::GetFirstDisplayDimension3

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [View::GetFirstDisplayDimension4](View__GetFirstDisplayDimension4.htm).

Description

This method returns the first display dimension in this drawing view.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = View.GetFirstDisplayDimension3
( )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to a Dispatch object, the first DisplayDimension object |

Syntax (COM)

status = View->IGetFirstDisplayDimension3
( &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (LPDISPLAYDIMENSION) retval | Pointer to the first DisplayDimension object |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

A SolidWorks dimension can be displayed more than once. For example,
the Base-Extrude dimension could be brought into three different views
on a drawing. These three dimensions are referred to as display dimensions
and are represented by the DisplayDimension object in the SolidWorks API.
The original Base-Extrude dimension is represented by the Dimension object
in the SolidWorks API.

This method is identical to the now obsolete View::GetFirstDisplayDimension2
except in the case of a dangling dimension. View::GetFirstDisplayDimension2
did not output it, this method does.
