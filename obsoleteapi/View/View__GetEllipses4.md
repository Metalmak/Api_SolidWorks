# View::GetEllipses4

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by View::GetEllipses5.

Description

This method gets all the ellipses
that were sketched in this drawing view.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = View.GetEllipses4 ( )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (VARIANT)retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray |

Syntax (COM)

status = View->IGetEllipses4 ( &retval
)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (double)retval | Pointer to an array of doubles |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method only returns ellipses
that have been deliberately sketched in this drawing view. All part and
assembly geometry shown in a drawing view is represented by polylines.
To access the polylines, use View::GetPolylines3.

The return values are in an array of doubles:

[ Color, LineType, LineStyleIndex, LineWeight,
StartPt[3], EndPt[3], CenterPt[3], MajorPt[3], MinorPt[3],Direction ... ]

where:

Color:
COLORREF returned as an integer. Return value could be 0 or -1 for default
color.

LineType:
line type. Valid returns as defined in swLineTypes\_e. A lineType
is a combination of a lineStyle and lineWeight.

LineStyleIndex:
index location of this line style inside SolidWorks line style manager.

LineWeight:
integer value defining the line weight.

StartPt[3]:
array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the ellipse start point

EndPt[3]:
array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the ellipse end point. If the ellipse
is closed, then this will be the same point as the StartPt..

CenterPt[3]:
array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the ellipse center point.

MajorPt[3]:
array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing a point on the ellipse and
on the major axis.

MinorPt[3]:
array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing a point on the ellipse and on the
minor axis.

Direction:
-1 for Clockwise, +1 for counterclockwise.

This set of data repeats for each ellipse in the view. The size of the
array is (NumEllipses \* 20). To determine the number of ellipses, use
View::GetEllipseCount.

The data returned from this method is in terms of view space. If you
want the data in terms of sheet space (for example, the 0,0 origin being
the lower-eft corner of the sheet), then combine this data with the three
return values from View::GetXForm.
