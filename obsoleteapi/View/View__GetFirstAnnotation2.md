Syntax (COM)

&retval )

Remarks

The difference between this method and the now obsolete View::GetFirstAnnotation
is that this method retrieves any display dimension, including suppressed,
hidden, or dangling dimensions. The sheet must be visible. See Sheet::SheetFormatVisible.

A dimension becomes suppressed or hidden when you specifically select
a dimension and hide it or when you select a feature and say hide all
dimensions. If you need to filter out these dimensions, you must use Annotation::Visible to check that status.

If the annotation is on a layer that is not shown, the annotation is
still returned.

If annotations are not displayed or any specific types of annotations
are not displayed due to the end-user setting some annotation properties,
use ModelDoc2::GetUserPreferenceToggle to discover those situations.
