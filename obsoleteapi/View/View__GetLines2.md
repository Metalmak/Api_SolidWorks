# View::GetLines2

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [View::GetLines3](View__GetLines3.htm).

Description

This method returns information for each line that was sketched in this
drawing view.

NOTE: This method only returns
lines that have been deliberately sketched in this drawing view. All part
and assembly geometry shown in a drawing view is represented by polylines.
To access the polylines, use View::GetPolylines3.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = View.GetLines2 ( )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray |

Syntax (COM)

status = View->IGetLines2 ( &retval
)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (double)retval | Pointer to an array of doubles |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The return value is the following array of doubles:

[ color, lineType, lineStyleIndex,
lineWeight, StartPtX, StartPtY, StartPtZ, EndPtX, EndPtY, EndPtZ, ... ]

where all data values are returned as doubles:

color =
COLORREF returned as an integer. Return value could be 0 or -1 for default
color.

LineType
= line type. Valid returns as defined in swLineTypes\_e. A lineType
is a combination of a lineStyle and lineWeight.

LineStyleIndex =
index location of this line style inside SolidWorks Line Style Manager.

lineWeight =
integer value defining the line weight.

where this array of 10 values repeats
itself for each line in the view. The number of doubles returned will
be (lineCount \* 10). To determine
the number of lines in the view, use  View::GetLineCount.

The data returned from this method is in terms of view space. If you
want the data in terms of sheet space (that is, the 0,0 origin being the
lower-left corner of the sheet), then combine this data with the three
return values from View::GetXForm.
