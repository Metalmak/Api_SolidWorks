Remarks

A dimension can be displayed more than once. For example, the Base-Extrude
dimension could be brought into three different views on a drawing. These
three dimensions are referred to as display dimensions and are represented
by the DisplayDimension object in the SolidWorks API. The original Base-Extrude
dimension is represented by the Dimension object in the SolidWorks API.
