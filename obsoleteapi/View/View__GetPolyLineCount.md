Remarks

| If... | Then... |
| Changes are made to the parts or assemblies shown in this drawing | Polylines are only generated that are in the visible viewing bounds when the drawing is opened. |
| Drawing is already open | All polylines in the drawing are generated. If you open a drawing that is zoomed in to a particular region, then the polylines that are outside the zoomed region do not exist if the parts or assemblies shown in this drawing have been changed. To force the generation of all possible polyline data, call ModelDoc2::ViewZoomtofit. |
