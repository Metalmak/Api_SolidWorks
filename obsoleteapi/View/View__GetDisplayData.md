# View::GetDisplayData

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [View::GetDisplayData2](View__GetDisplayData2.htm).

Description

This method gets the DisplayData object for this drawing view.

NOTE: The DisplayData object
provides information for additional display data, such as reference plane
display, reference axis display, unused sketch geometry from a part, and
so on. The data kept with the DisplayData object is strictly for display
purposes and allows you to recreate unintelligent  geometry.
It does not provide associations or detailed information about the geometry.
