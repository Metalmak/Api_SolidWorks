# View::GetSplines

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [View::GetSplines2](View__GetSplines2.htm).

Description

This method returns information for each spline sketched in this drawing
view.

NOTE: This method only returns splines that have been deliberately sketched
in this drawing view. All part and assembly geometry shown in a drawing
view is represented by polylines. To access the polylines, use View::GetPolylines5.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = View.GetSplines ()

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray |

Syntax (COM)

status = View->IGetSplines ( retval
)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (double\*) retval | Pointer to an array of doubles |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Format of return values is an array of doubles with the format:

[ [ Color,
LineTypeIndex, NumSplinePoints, [x,y,z] ]
… ]

This complete set of data repeats itself for each spline found in the
view. For each spline, the array returned contains the color, line type,
number of spline points in the spline, and X,Y,Z value for each of those
points. Therefore, the [x,y,z] parameter is an array of NumSplinePoints,
which may vary in size from spline to spline.

The [x,y,z] points for each
spline are not the same as the points used to generate the spline. This
method tessellates the spline based on the display quality and place points
along the spline appropriately.

See swLineTypes\_e for valid line types.

The data returned from this method is in terms of view space. If you
want the data in terms of sheet space (that is, the 0,0 origin being the
lower left-corner of the sheet), then combine this data with the three
return values from View::GetXForm.

To determine the number of splines in
the view, use View::GetSplineCount or get the number of elements in the
SafeArray returned by this method.

If you are using COM, then your call to View::GetSplines must be preceded
by a call to View::GetSplineCount.
