# View::GetDimensionIds3

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by View::GetDimensionIds4.

Description

This method returns a list of dimension names from the current drawing
view.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = View.GetDimensionIds3 ()

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray of strings; each string represents one dimension name from the current drawing view |

Syntax (COM)

status = View->IGetDimensionIds3
( &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (BSTR) retval | Array of strings; each string represents one dimension name from the current drawing view |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The order of the dimension names returned align with the order of information
returned from View::GetDimensionInfo5. This alignment of information is
valid as long as the calls to this method and View::GetDimensionInfo5
are made consecutively.

One string is returned for each dimension in the view. See View::GetDimensionCount3
to determine the number of dimensions in the view.

This method is identical to the now obsolete View::GetDimensionIds2
except View::GetDimensionIds2 did not output dangling dimensions. This
method does.
