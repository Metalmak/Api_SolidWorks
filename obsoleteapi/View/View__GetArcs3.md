# View::GetArcs3

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by View::GetArcs4.

Description

This method returns information for each arc that was sketched in this
drawing view.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = View.GetArcs3 ( )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray containing an array of doubles |

Syntax (COM)

status = View->IGetArcs3 ( &retval
)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (double)retval | Pointer to an array of doubles |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method returns arcs that have been deliberately sketched in this
drawing view. All part and assembly geometry shown in a drawing view is
represented by polylines. To access the polylines, use View::GetPolylines3.

Return value is an array of doubles with the format:

[ Color, LineType, LineStyleIndex, LineWeight,
StartPt[3], EndPt[3], CenterPt[3], RotDir, ...
]

where:

Color is
the COLORREF returned as an integer. Return value could be 0 or -1 for
default color.

LineType is
the line type. Valid returns are found in the swLineTypes\_e enumeration.
A lineType is a combination of a lineStyle and lineWeight.

LineStyleIndex is
the index location of this line style inside SolidWorks Line Style Manager.

LineWeight is
an integer value defining the line weight

StartPt[3] equals
an array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the start point.

EndPt[3] equal
an array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the end point. If the arc is
closed, then this is the same point as the StartPt.

CenterPt[3] is
an array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the center point.

RotDir equals
the rotational direction (CW = -1, CCW = 1)

...

This set of data repeats for each arc in the view. The size of the array
is (NumArcs \* 14). To determine the number of arcs, use View::GetArcCount.

The data returned from this method is in terms of view space. If you
want the data in terms of sheet space (for example, the 0,0 origin being
the lower-left corner of the sheet), then combine this data with the three
return values from View::GetXForm.
