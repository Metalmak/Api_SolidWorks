# View::GetDimensionInfo2

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [View::GetDimensionInfo3](View__GetDimensionInfo3.htm).

Description

This method gets all the dimension information in the view. All values
returned are in meters.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = View.GetDimensionInfo2 ( )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray containing the dimension information |

Syntax (COM)

status = View->IGetDimensionInfo2
( &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (double) retval | Pointer to an array of doubles containing the dimension information |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

For COM implementation, use View::GetDimensionCount to determine the
overall size of the array needed. The maximum number of doubles contained
in the array will be (1 + dimensionCount
\* 47).

The data returned is an array of doubles as follows:

[
dimensionCount,
[ dimensionType, lineStyle, refPoint1a[3], refPoint1b[3],
refPoint2a[3], refPoint2b[3], refPoint3[3],
textPoint[3], textDirection[3], dimNormal[3],
angularDimInfo[9], precision,
arrowLength, arrowHeadWidth, arrowHeadHeight, arrowHeadStyle, witnessGap,
witnessExt, dimValue, textHeight, arrowsOut, isDiameter, RadialDimensionflags
]
]

where:

dimensionCount
 = the number of dimensions found in the drawing view.

For each dimension, we have a repeating
set of the following data:

dimensionType =
returns 0 = Linear, 1 = Angular, 2 = Radial, 3 = Ordinate.

lineStyle =
line style (Dimension Style = 5).

refPoint1a[3]  = array of three doubles.

refPoint1b[3]  = array of three doubles.

refPoint2a[3]  = array of three doubles.

refPoint2b[3]  = array of three doubles.

refPoint3[3]  = array of three doubles.

textPoint[3]  = array of three doubles. This
is the upper-left corner of the dimension bounding box.

textDirection[3]  = array of three doubles.

dimNormal[3] = array of three doubles.

angularDimInfo[9]  = data is only returned for
angular dimensions. The array of 9 values is as follows:

quadrant
 = as defined in swQuadant\_e.

directionLine1[3] =
array of three doubles.

directionLine2[3] =
array of three doubles.

isInteriorAngle =
BOOLEAN returned as a double. TRUE if it is an interior angle.

isFlipped
 = BOOLEAN  returned
as a double. TRUE if it is flipped.

precision =
number of decimal places

arrowLength =
arrow length

arrowHeadWidth =
arrowhead width

arrowHeadHeight =
arrowhead height

arrowHeadStyle =
arrowhead style. See swArrowStyle\_e.

witnessGap =
extension gap

witnessExt =
extension's extension

dimValue =
dimension value

textHeight =
dimension text height

arrowsOut
 = BOOLEAN returned as a double and is TRUE if the arrows are outside.

isDiameter
 = BOOLEAN  returned
as a double and is used by radial dimensions. If this value is TRUE, then
the dimValue returned will be
the diameter value, if FALSE then the dimValue
returned is the radial value.

RadialDimensionflags =
bit code defining properties for radial dimensions or 0 if the
dimension is not radial. See RadialDimensionFlags.
