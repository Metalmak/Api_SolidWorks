# View::GetDimensionInfo5

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by View::GetDimensionInfo6.

Description

This method gets all of the dimension information in the view. All values
returned are in meters.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = View.GetDimensionInfo5 ( )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray containing the dimension information |

Syntax (COM)

status = View->IGetDimensionInfo5
( retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (double\*) retval | Pointer to an array of doubles containing the dimension information |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

For COM implementation, use View::GetDimensionCount4 to determine the
overall size of the array needed. The maximum number of doubles contained
in the array will be (1 + dimensionCount
\* 51).

The data returned is an array of doubles as follows:

[
dimensionCount, [ dimensionType,
LineStyleIndex, LineWidth, Color, LayerID, LayerOverride, refPoint1a[3], refPoint1b[3],
refPoint2a[3], refPoint2b[3], refPoint3[3],
textPoint[3], textDirection[3], dimNormal[3],
angularDimInfo[9], precision,
arrowLength, arrowHeadWidth, arrowHeadHeight, arrowHeadStyle, witnessGap,
witnessExt, dimValue, textHeight, arrowsOut, isDiameter, RadialDimensionflags
]
]

where:

dimensionCount
 = the number of dimensions found in the drawing view

For each dimension, you have a repeating
set of the following data:

dimensionType =
returns 0 = Linear, 1 = Angular, 2 = Radial, 3 = Ordinate.

LineStyleIndex =
line style. Valid line styles as defined in swLineStyles\_e.

LineWidth =
integer value defining the line width. Valid width values as defined in
swLineWeights\_e.

Color =
COLORREF returned as an integer. Return value could be 0 or -1 for default
color.

LayerID =
integer value indicating which layer holds this entity. This integer value
is the array index value into the layerList array. Obtain the layerList
array using LayerMgr::GetLayerList. A value of –1 indicates that this
item is not on a layer.

LayerOverride =
integer with bit flags set to determine which properties, if any, have
been overridden with respect to the Layer default properties. If the bit
value is set, then the specific property or properties have been overridden.
The bit indicators are: color = 0x1, style = 0x2, and width = 0x4. Therefore,
if LayerOverride was returned
as 3, you know the color and style have been specifically set for this
item and may not match the default values associated with this item's
layer.

refPoint1a[3]  = array of three doubles.

refPoint1b[3]  = array of three doubles.

refPoint2a[3]  = array of three doubles.

refPoint2b[3]  = array of three doubles.

refPoint3[3]  = array of three doubles.

textPoint[3]  = array of three doubles. This
is the upper-left corner of the dimension bounding box.

textDirection[3]  = array of three doubles

dimNormal[3] = array of three doubles

angularDimInfo[9]  This data is only returned for
angular dimensions. The array of 9 values is as follows:

quadrant
 = as defined in swQuadant\_e.

directionLine1[3] =
array of three doubles.

directionLine2[3] =
array of three doubles.

isInteriorAngle =
BOOLEAN returned as a double. TRUE if it is an interior angle.

isFlipped
 = BOOLEAN returned as a double. TRUE if it is flipped.

precision =
number of decimal places.

arrowLength =
arrow length.

arrowHeadWidth =
arrowhead width.

arrowHeadHeight =
arrowhead height.

arrowHeadStyle =
arrowhead style as defined in swArrowStyle\_e.

witnessGap =
extension gap.

witnessExt =
extension's extension.

dimValue =
dimension value.

textHeight =
dimension text height.

arrowsOut
 = BOOLEAN  returned
as a double and is TRUE if the arrows are outside.

isDiameter
 = BOOLEAN  returned
as a double and is used by radial dimensions. If this value is TRUE, then
the dimValue returned is the
diameter value; if FALSE, then the dimValue
returned is the radial value.

RadialDimensionflags
 = bit code defining properties for radial dimensions or 0
if the dimension is not radial. See RadialDimensionFlags.
