# Edge::GetTwoAdjacentFaces

This method is obsolete and has been superseded by
Edge::GetTwoAdjacentFaces2.

Description

This method returns the two adjacent faces to an edge.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= Edge.GetTwoAdjacentFaces ()

| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT containing a SafeArray of two Dispatch pointers to the two faces |

Syntax (COM)

status
= Edge->IGetTwoAdjacentFaces ( &face1, &face2 )

| Output: | (LPFACE) face1 | Pointer to the first adjacent face |
| Output: | (LPFACE) face2 | Pointer to the second adjacent face |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Call this method for body-related edges, not reference
curve or sketch edges.

This method returns two faces only if the body
is a solid body. If it is not, then the Dispatch version returns VT\_EMPTY
and the COM version returns S\_FALSE.
