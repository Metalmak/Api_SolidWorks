# CustomSymbol::GetTriangleAtIndex

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by Note::GetTriangleAtIndex.

Description

This method gets the triangle at the specified index.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= CustomSymbol.GetTriangleAtIndex ( index)

| Input: | (long) index | Index of the triangle where the index begins at zero |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray of doubles (see below) |

Syntax (COM)

status
= CustomSymbol->IGetTriangleAtIndex ( index, retval )

| Input: | (long) index | Index of the triangle where the index begins at zero |
| Output: | (double\*) retval | Pointer to an array of doubles (see below) |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The return value is the following array of doubles:

[ vertexPt1[3],
vertexPt2[3], vertexPt3[3],
isFilled, lineType
]

| vertexPt1[3] | First XYZ vertex point |
| vertexPt2[3] | Second XYZ vertex point |
| vertexPt3[3] | Third XYZ vertex point |
| isFilled | Boolean returned as a double and is TRUE if the triangle is filled, FALSE otherwise |
| lineType | Line type as defined in swLineTypes\_e |
