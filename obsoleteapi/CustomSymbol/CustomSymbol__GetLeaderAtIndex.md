# CustomSymbol::GetLeaderAtIndex

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by Note::GetLeaderAtIndex.

Description

This
method gets information about the specified leader on this symbol.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= CustomSymbol.GetLeaderAtIndex ( index )

| Input: | (long) index | Index of leader |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray (see below) |

Syntax (COM)

status
= CustomSymbol->IGetLeaderAtIndex ( index, &PointCount, retval
)

| Input: | (long) index | Index of leader |
| Output: | (long) PointCount | Number of (x,y,z) points being returned in the array |
| Output: | (double\*) retval | Pointer to array of doubles (see below) |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if Successful |

Remarks

The leader line might use 0, 1 or 2 lines. If the CustomSymbol is not
attached, there are 0 lines; a straight leaderline is 1 line, and a bent
leaderline is 2 lines. You must infer the number of leader lines based
on IsAttached() and HasExtraLeader().

IsAttached() == FALSE implies no leaderline
and there are therefore no leaderline points (PointCount=0).

HasExtraLeader() == FALSE means that this
is a straight leaderline and there will therefore be 1 line (PointCount=2)

HasExtraLeader() == TRUE means that this
is a bent leaderline and there will therefore be 2 lines (PointCount=3)

The return value uses the following format:

retval[0]
= X-coord of first leader point

retval[1]
= Y-coord of first leader point

retval[2]
= Z-coord of first leader point

retval[3]
= X-coord of second leader point

retval[4]
= Y-coord of second leader point

retval[5]
= Z-coord of second leader point

retval[6]
= X-coord of third leader point

retval[7]
= Y-coord of third leader point

retval[8]
= Z-coord of third leader point

Use [CustomSymbol::GetLeaderCount](CustomSymbol__GetLeaderCount.htm)
to determine how many leaders are on the CustomSymbol object.
