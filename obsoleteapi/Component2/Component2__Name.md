# Component2::Name

This
property is obsolete and has been superseded by Component2::Name2.

Description

This property gets the component name that appears in the FeatureManager
design tree, and is not necessarily the same as the name of the underlying
part or assembly file.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

Name
= Component2.Name (VB Get property)

Name
= Component2.GetName ( ) (C++ Get property)

| Property: | (BSTR) Name | Name of this component instance |

Syntax (COM)

status
= Component2->get\_Name( &Name )

| Property: | (BSTR) Name | Name of this component instance |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This property returns a name that includes an instance number. For example:

Part1-1

indicates that this is the first instance of the Part1 Component2. If
you are examining a component that is within a subassembly, then this
property returns a name that includes the full hierarchical path of component
names. For example:

subAssem1-2/Part1-1

indicates that this component (Part1) is the first instance within the
subAssem1 Component2. It also shows that the second instance of subAssem1
is referenced.

Additionally, the User Option,
External Reference setting allows
or prohibits changes to this name. This setting affects only interactive
user operations.

If you are setting the name of a component, remember that some special
characters are reserved by SolidWorks.
