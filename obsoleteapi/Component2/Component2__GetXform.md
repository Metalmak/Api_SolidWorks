Remarks

If the current configuration is exploded, then SolidWorks returns the
exploded transform, which is an array of 16 elements. The first 9 are
elements of a standard 3x3 rotation matrix, the next 3 define translation,
the next 1 is scaling, and the last 3 elements are unused.

SolidWorks returns the transform in relation
to the root component. See Configuration::GetRootComponent for more information.
