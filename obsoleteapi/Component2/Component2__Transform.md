# Component2::Transform

This property is obsolete and has been superseded
by Component2::Transform2.

Description

This property gets or sets the component transform.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

form
= Component2.Transform ( )  (VB Get property)

Component2.Transform
= form (VB Set property)

form
= Component2.GetTransform ( ) (C++ Get property)

void
Component2.SetTransform ( form ) (C++ Set property)

| Property: | (LPMATHTRANSFORM) form | Component transform |

Syntax (COM)

status = Component2->get\_Transform ( &form
)

status = Component2->put\_Transform ( form )

| Property: | (LPMATHTRANSFORM) form | Component transform |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

You must specify the transform in relation to the root component. See
Configuration::GetRootComponent.

This property does not support setting the transform of a component
within a subassembly. To do this, open the subassembly document and get
the desired component in the context of the subassembly document.

You can call ModelDoc2::Rebuild with the swUpdateMates argument to rebuild
the model after transforming a component. This is much faster than rebuilding
all of the geometry for the model using [Assembly\_Doc::EditRebuild](../AssemblyDoc/AssemblyDoc__EditRebuild.htm).

This property lets you violate existing mate relationships. If you place
a component at an invalid location based on the mate definitions, then
ModelDoc2::Rebuild recalculates existing mate relationships and moves
your components to the closest valid location.

After you change a component's transform, you can call AssemblyDoc::UpdateBox
to avoid clipping in shaded display mode.
