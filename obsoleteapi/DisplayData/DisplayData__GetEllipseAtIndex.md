# DisplayData::GetEllipseAtIndex

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by DisplayData:GetEllipseAtIndex2.

Description

This method gets information for the specified
ellipse.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= DisplayData.GetEllipseAtIndex ( index)

| Input: | (long) index | Index of the desired ellipse where the index begins at zero |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray of doubles (see below) |

Syntax (COM)

status
= DisplayData->IGetEllipseAtIndex ( index, retval )

| Input: | (long) index | Index of the desired ellipse where the index begins at zero |
| Output: | (double\*) retval | Pointer to an array of doubles (see below) |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The return value is the following array of doubles
:

[ LineType, StartPt[3], EndPt[3], CenterPt[3], MajorPt[3],
MinorPt[3], ... ]

| LineType | Line type. Valid returns are found in the swLineTypes\_e. |
| StartPt[3] | Array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the ellipse start point. |
| EndPt[3] | Array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the ellipse end point. If the ellipse is closed, this is the same point as StartPt. |
| CenterPt[3] | Array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing the ellipse center point. |
| MajorPt[3] | Array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing a point on the ellipse and on the major axis. |
| MinorPt[3] | Array of 3 doubles (X,Y,Z) describing a point on the ellipse and on the minor axis. |
