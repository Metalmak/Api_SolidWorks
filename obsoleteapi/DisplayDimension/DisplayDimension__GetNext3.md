# DisplayDimension::GetNext3

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [DisplayDimension::GetNext4](DisplayDimension__GetNext4.htm).

Description

This method gets the next display dimension.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = DisplayDimension.GetNext3
( )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to a Dispatch object, the next DisplayDimension |

Syntax (COM)

status = DisplayDimension->IGetNext3
( &retval )

| Output: | (LPDISPLAYDIMENSION) retval | Pointer to the next DisplayDimension object |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

SolidWorks can display a dimension more than once. For example, a base-extrude
dimension can be brought into three different views on a drawing. These
three dimensions are referred to as "Display Dimensions" and
are represented by the DisplayDimension object in the SolidWorks API.
The original base-extrude dimension is represented by the Dimension object
in the SolidWorks API.

This method is identical to DisplayDimension::GetNext2, except that
it returns dangling dimensions.
