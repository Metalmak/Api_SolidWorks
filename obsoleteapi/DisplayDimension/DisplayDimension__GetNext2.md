# DisplayDimension::GetNext2

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [DisplayDimension::GetNext3](DisplayDimension__GetNext3.htm).

Description

This method gets the next display dimension.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= DisplayDimension.GetNext2 ( )

| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to a Dispatch object, the next DisplayDimension |

Syntax (COM)

status
= DisplayDimension->IGetNext2 ( &retval )

| Output: | (LPDISPLAYDIMENSION) retval | Pointer to the next DisplayDimension object |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

SolidWorks can display a dimension more than once. For example, a base-extrude
dimension can be brought into three different views on a drawing. These
three dimensions are referred to as "Display Dimensions" and
are represented by the DisplayDimension object in the SolidWorks API.
The original base-extrude dimension is represented by the Dimension object
in the SolidWorks API.

This method is identical to DisplayDimension::GetNext with one exception.
When a base ordinate is not visible, DisplayDimension::GetNext  does
not return the sub-ordinates, regardless of whether they are visible.
DisplayDimension::GetNext2returns all visible sub-ordinates whether or
not its base ordinate is visible.
