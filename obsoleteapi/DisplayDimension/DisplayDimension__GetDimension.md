# DisplayDimension::GetDimension

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by DisplayDimension::GetDimension2.

Description

This
method gets the model dimension that was used to create this display dimension.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= DisplayDimension.GetDimension ( )

| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to a Dispatch object, the model Dimension object |

Syntax (COM)

= DisplayDimension->IGetDimension ( &retval )

Remarks

SolidWorks can display a dimension more than once. For example, a base-extrude
dimension can be brought into three different views on a drawing. These
three dimensions are referred to as display dimensions and are represented
by the DisplayDimension object in the SolidWorks API. The original base-extrude
dimension is represented by the Dimension object in the SolidWorks API.
