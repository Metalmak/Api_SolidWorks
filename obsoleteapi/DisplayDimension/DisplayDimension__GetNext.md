Remarks

SolidWorks can display a dimension more than once. For example, a base-extrude
dimension can be brought into three different views on a drawing. These
three dimensions are referred to as "Display Dimensions" and
are represented by the DisplayDimension object in the SolidWorks API.
The original base-extrude dimension is represented by the Dimension object
in the SolidWorks API.
