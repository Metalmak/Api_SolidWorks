# DisplayDimension::GetNext4

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by DisplayDimension::GetNext5.

Description

This method gets the next display dimension.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = DisplayDimension.GetNext4
( )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (LPDISPLAYDIMENSION) retval | Pointer to the next DisplayDimension object |

Syntax (COM)

status = DisplayDimension->GetNext4
( &retval )

| Output: | (LPDISPLAYDIMENSION) retval | Pointer to the next DisplayDimension object |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

SolidWorks can display a dimension more than once. For example, a base-extrude
dimension can be brought into three different views on a drawing. These
three dimensions are referred to as display dimensions and are represented
by the DisplayDimension object in the SolidWorks API. The original base-extrude
dimension is represented by the Dimension object in the SolidWorks API.

This method includes suppressed dimensions.
