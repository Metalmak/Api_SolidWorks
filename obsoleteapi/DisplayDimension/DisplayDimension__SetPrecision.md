# DisplayDimension::SetPrecision

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by DisplayDimension::SetPrecison2.

Description

This method sets the displayed precisions of
this display dimension and its tolerance values.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = DisplayDimension.SetPrecision
( useDoc, primary, alternate, primaryTol, alternateTol
)

| Input: | (BOOL) useDoc | TRUE uses the document settings, FALSE uses the settings on this display dimension (see below) |
| Input: | (long) primary | Number of decimal places displayed in the dimension value |
| Input: | (long) alternate | Number of decimal places displayed in the dual dimension value |
| Input: | (long) primaryTol | Number of decimal places displayed in the tolerance value |
| Input: | (long) alternateTol | Number of decimal places displayed in the dual tolerance value |
| Return: | (long) retval | Return status (see below) |

Syntax (COM)

status = DisplayDimension->SetPrecision
( useDoc, primary, alternate, primaryTol, alternateTol, &retval )

| Input: | (BOOL) useDoc | TRUE uses the document settings, FALSE uses the settings on this display dimension (see below) |
| Input: | (long) primary | Number of decimal places displayed in the dimension value |
| Input: | (long) alternate | Number of decimal places displayed in the dual dimension value |
| Input: | (long) primaryTol | Number of decimal places displayed in the tolerance value |
| Input: | (long) alternateTol | Number of decimal places displayed in the dual tolerance value |
| Output: | (long) retval | Return status (see below) |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The displayed precision of a dimension and its
tolerance values can be controlled by a value is stored in one of two
places: on the owning document or on the individual display dimension.
The useDoc argument allows you
to control whether to use the default document settings or the values
specified in the primary, alternate, primaryTol,
and alternateTol arguments.

If useDoc
is TRUE, then SolidWorks ignores the primary,
alternate, primaryTol,
and alternateTol arguments.

The specified precision values must be in the range
between 0 and 8. This indicates to SolidWorks how many decimal places
to display. You can also set the precision to -1, which maintains the
current setting. SolidWorks considers any other values invalid. If a precision
is invalid, SolidWorks uses the current setting and continues processing
he other precision values.

retval
indicates the success or failure of this method. In general, a value less
than 0 indicates that the command failed and SolidWorks did not set any
precision values. A value of 0 indicates success. A value greater than
0 indicates that a problem occurred, but the command did not fail.

| -1 | Command failed, no precision values were set |
| 0 | Command was successful, all precision values were set |
| 1 | Primary precision argument was invalid |
| 2 | Alternate precision argument was invalid |
| 3 | Primary tolerance precision argument was invalid |
| 4 | Alternate tolerance precision argument was invalid |
