# SketchHatch::SelectByMark

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [SketchHatch::Select2](SketchHatch__Select2.htm).

Description

This method selects the sketch hatch and appends
it to the current set of selections or replaces the entire selection list.
The selection is also marked with the value specified. This mark is used
by certain API methods that require multiple selections.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = SketchHatch.SelectByMark ( appendFlag, markValue )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BOOL) appendFlag | TRUE if you want to append to the current selection list, FALSE if you want this item to replace the current selection list |
| Input: | (long) markValue | Number you want to use as a mark; this number is used by certain API functions that require ordered entity selection |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if successfully selected, FALSE if not |

Syntax (COM)

status = SketchHatch ->SelectByMark ( appendFlag, markValue, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BOOL) appendFlag | TRUE if you wan to append to the current selection list, FALSE if you want this item to replace the current selection list |
| Input: | (long) markValue | Number you want to use as a mark, this number is used by certain API functions that require ordered entity selection |
| Output: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if successfully selected, FALSE if not |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method does not work well when a PropertyManager
page is open or a command is running. Use ModelDoc2::SelectByMark instead
of using this method. ModelDoc2::SelectByMark handles selection correctly
whether or not a command is running.
