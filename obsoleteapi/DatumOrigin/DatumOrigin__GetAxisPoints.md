Remarks

This method gives the end user control over the
shape of the symbol.

The array of 4 doubles is 2 (X,Y) coordinates in
drawing space:

* The first
  coordinate (array items 0 and 1) is the tip of the arrowhead on the X
  leader portion of the symbol.
* The second
  coordinate (array items 2 and 3) is the tip of the arrowhead on the Y
  leader portion of the symbol.

The end user has this control via the selection
drag handles of the symbol.
