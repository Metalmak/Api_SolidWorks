This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by Modeler::CreateCylindricalSurface2.

Description

This method creates an untrimmed cylindrical
surface from the specified arguments.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Modeler.CreateCylindricalSurface ( center,
direction, radius )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT) center | VARIANT of type SafeArray containing 3 doubles (see Remarks) |
