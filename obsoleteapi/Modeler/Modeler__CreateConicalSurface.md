# Modeler::CreateConicalSurface

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by Modeler::CreateConicalSurface2.

Description

This method creates an untrimmed conical surface
from the specified arguments.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Modeler.CreateConicalSurface ( center, direction,
radius, semiAngle )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT) center | VARIANT of type SafeArray containing 3 doubles (see Remarks) |
| Input: | (VARIANT) direction | VARIANT of type SafeArray containing 3 doubles (see Remarks) |
| Input: | (double) radius | (see Remarks) |
| Input: | (double) semiAngle | (see Remarks) |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Dispatch pointer to the resulting Surface object |

Syntax (COM)

status = Modeler->ICreateConicalSurface ( center,
direction, radius, semiAngle, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double\*) center | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (see Remarks) |
| Input: | (double\*) direction | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (see Remarks) |
| Input: | (double) radius | (see Remarks) |
| Input: | (double) semiAngle | (see Remarks) |
| Output: | (LPSURFACE) retval | Pointer to the resulting Surface object |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The input arguments are:

* center
  – an XYZ location that represents the center of the bottom.
* direction
  – an XYZ direction of the axis of the conical surface.
* radius
  – the radius at the center.
* semiAngle
  – the half angle of the cone in radians.
