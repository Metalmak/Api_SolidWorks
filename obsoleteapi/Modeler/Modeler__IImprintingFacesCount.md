Description

This method returns the number of imprinted
edges and vertices

Syntax (OLE Automation)

Not available.

Syntax (COM)

status = Modeler->IImprintingFacesCount ( nTargetFaces,
\*targetFaceArray, nToolFaces, \*toolFaceArray, options, \*nTargetEdges,
\*ntoolEdges, \*ntargetVertices, \*toolVertices, \*retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) nTargetFaces | Number of faces in the target body |
| Input: | (LPFACE) \*targetFaceArray | List of the faces that describe the target body |
| Input: | (long) nToolFaces | Number of faces in the tool body |
| Input: | (LPFACE) \*toolFaceArray | List of the faces that describe the tool body |
| Input: | (long) options | Options for this operation as defined in swImprintingFacesOpts\_e |
| Output: | (long) \*nTargetEdges | Number of edges returned from this operation |
| Output: | (long) \*ntoolEdges | Number of tool edges returned from this operation |
| Output: | (long) \*ntargetVertices | Number of target vertices returned from this operation |
| Output: | (long) \*toolVertices | Number of tool vertices returned from this operation |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) \*retval | TRUE if the operation is successful, FALSE otherwise |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |
