# Modeler::CreateSphericalSurface

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by Modeler::CreateSphericalSurface2.

Description

This method creates an untrimmed spherical
surface from the specified arguments.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Modeler.CreateSphericalSurface ( center,
radius )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT) center | VARIANT of type SafeArray containing 3 doubles (see Remarks) |
| Input: | (double) radius | See Remarks |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Dispatch pointer to the resulting surface |

Syntax (COM)

status = Modeler->ICreateSphericalSurface ( center,
radius, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double\*) center | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (see Remarks) |
| Input: | (double) radius | See Remarks |
| Output: | (LPSURFACE) retval | Pointer to the resulting surface |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Input arguments:

* center
  – an XYZ location which represents the center of the spherical surface.
* radius
  – the radius at the center.

You can trim the resulting surface can be
trimmed using, for example, Surface::CreateTrimmedSheet, to generate a
sheet body.
