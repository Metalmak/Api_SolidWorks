# Modeler::ICreateBodyFromBox2

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by Modeler::CreateBodyFromBox3.

Description

This method creates a temporary body from box
dimensions.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

See Modeler::CreateBodyFromBox.

Syntax (COM)

status = Modeler->ICreateBodyFromBox2 ( boxDimArray,
&retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double\*) boxDimArray | Pointer to an array of 9 doubles (see Remarks) |
| Output: | (LPBODY2) retval | Pointer to the resulting Body2 object |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

#

Remarks

The input parameter is the
following array of doubles:

[
boxFaceCenter[3], boxAxis[3], boxWidth,
boxLength, boxHeight ]

where:

| boxFaceCenter[3] | XYZ location that represents the center of one of the box faces. |
| boxAxis[3] | XYZ direction. The box will be extruded along this vector from the boxFaceCenter location, a distance of boxHeight. |
| boxWidth | Box width. If boxAxis is parallel to the Z axis (0,0,1), then this value represents the dimension which is parallel to the X axis; otherwise, the orientation is not defined. |
| boxLength | Box length. If boxAxis is parallel to the Z axis (0,0,1), then this value represents the dimension that is parallel to the Y axis; otherwise, the orientation is not defined. |
| boxHeight | Height to extrude along the boxAxis direction. If boxHeight is 0, a sheet body will be created of dimension boxWidth x boxLength and whose normal is defined by boxAxis. |
