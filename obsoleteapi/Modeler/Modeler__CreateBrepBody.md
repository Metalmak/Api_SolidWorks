Remarks

If non-negative values are packed into the edgeTolArray
and vertexTolArray arrays, then tolerances are applied to the corresponding
edges or vertices. These arrays should be the same size as curveArray
and pointArray, respectively. Otherwise, a default value of 1.0e-8 (modeler
precision) is used.

NOTE: Modeler::SetInitKnitGapWidth
does not affect this method.

Useful methods for creating geometry for the topological entities are:

* Body2::CreatePlanarSurface
* Body2::AddProfileArc
* Body2::AddProfileLine
* Body2::CreateRevolutionSurface

For example, to create a cone, find topological
relationships and form relevant arrays. A  complete
solid cone consists of 8 topological entities:

+ 1 shell
+ 2 faces
+ 3 loops
+ 1 edge
+ 1 vertex

There are 8 relations:

+ the shell is the
  parent of 2 faces - 2
+ the planar end face
  has 1 loop - 1
+ the conical face
  has 2 loops - 2
+ two loops are each
  the parent of 1 edge - 2
+ one loop is the
  parent of 1 vertex – 1

The topologies array:

| Index | Value |
| 0 | swTopoShell |
| 1 | swTopoFace |
| 2 | swTopoFace |
| 3 | swTopoLoop |
| 4 | swTopoEdge |
| 5 | swTopoLoop |
| 6 | swTopoLoop |
| 7 | swTopoVertex |

The set of arrays:

| index | parents | children | senses | relation |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | shell to face |
| 1 | 0 | 2 | 0 | shell to face |
| 2 | 1 | 3 | 0 | face to loop |
| 3 | 3 | 4 | -1 | loop to edge |
| 4 | 2 | 5 | 0 | face to loop |
| 5 | 2 | 6 | 0 | face to loop |
| 6 | 5 | 4 | 1 | loop to edge |
| 7 | 6 | 7 | 0 | loop to vertex |

Values in the parents and children arrays correspond to the indices
of the topology array.
