# PartDoc::FeatureRevolveThinCut

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by FeatureManager::FeatureRevolveThinCut.

Description

This method creates a feature by revolving a profile about an axis.
A constant thickness is given to the profile when revolving. The result
is then removed from the existing work piece

Syntax (OLE Automation)

(void) PartDoc.FeatureRevolveThinCut
( angle, reverseDir, angle2, revType, thickness1, thickness2, thinType
)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) angle | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) reverseDir | Angle is positive or negative (TRUE or FALSE) |
| Input: | (double) angle2 | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (long) revType | Type of revolution |
| Input: | (double) thickness1 | Wall thickness 1 (thinType = 2 uses (thickness1)/2 for each direction) |
| Input: | (double) thickness2 | Wall thickness 2 (only used when thinType = 3) |
| Input: | (long) thinType | Thin feature type:   * 0 = One direction * 1 = One direction reverse * 2 = Midplane * 3 = Two direction |

Syntax (COM)

status = PartDoc->FeatureRevolveThinCut
( angle, reverseDir, angle2, revType, thickness1, thickness2, thinType
)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) angle | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) reverseDir | Angle is positive or negative (TRUE or FALSE) |
| Input: | (double) angle2 | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (long) revType | Type of revolution |
| Input: | (double) thickness1 | Wall thickness 1 (thinType = 2 uses (thickness1)/2 for each direction) |
| Input: | (double) thickness2 | Wall thickness 2 (only used when thinType = 3) |
| Input: | (long) thinType | Thin feature type:   * 0 = One direction * 1 = One direction reverse * 2 = Midplane * 3 = Two direction |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Type of revolution:

* 0= one direction
* 1= midPlane
* 2=two direction
