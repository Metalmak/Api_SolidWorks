# PartDoc::FeatureRevolveThin

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by FeatureManager::FeatureRevolveThin.

Description

This method creates a feature by revolving a profile about an axis.
A constant thickness is given to the profile when revolving. The result
is then added to the existing work piece.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

(void) PartDoc.FeatureRevolveThin (
angle, reverseDir, angle2, revType, thickness1, thickness2, thinType )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) angle | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) reverseDir | Angle is positive or negative ( TRUE or FALSE) |
| Input: | (double) angle2 | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (long) revType | Type of feature revolution |
| Input: | (double) thickness1 | Wall thickness 1 (thinType = 2 uses (thickness1)/2 for each direction) |
| Input: | (double) thickness2 | Wall thickness 2 (only used when thinType = 3) |
| Input: | (long) thinType | Thin feature type:   * 0 = One direction * 1 = One direction reverse * 2 = Midplane * 3 = Two direction |

Syntax (COM)

status = PartDoc->FeatureRevolveThin ( angle,
reverseDir, angle2 revType, thickness1, thickness2, thinType )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) angle | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) reverseDir | Angle is positive or negative (TRUE or FALSE) |
| Input: | (double) angle2 | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (long) revType | Type of revolution |
| Input: | (double) thickness1 | Wall thickness 1 (thinType = 2 uses (thickness1)/2 for each direction) |
| Input: | (double) thickness2 | Wall thickness 2 (only used when thinType = 3) |
| Input: | (long) thinType | Thin feature Type:   * 0 = One direction * 1 = One direction reverse * 2 = Midplane * 3 = Two direction |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The revType argument can be one of the following values:

* 0 = One-direction revolution.
* 1 = Midplane revolution. For this type of revolve,
  the angle specification specifies the full revolution. The angle to revolve
  is (angle/2 ) on either side of the sketch. The reverseDir argument has
  no affect.
* 2 = Two-direction revolution. For this type of
  revolve, the angle is the angle to revolve in Direction1 and angle2 is
  the angle to be revolved in Direction2.
