# PartDoc::FeatureRevolve

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by FeatureManager::FeatureRevolve.

Description

This method creates a revolved feature. This feature is either a base
feature or a subsequent boss feature.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void PartDoc.FeatureRevolve ( angle,
reverseDir, angle2, revType)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) angle | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) reverseDir | Positive or negative angle (TRUE or FALSE) |
| Input: | (double) angle2 | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (long) revType | Type of revolution |

Syntax (COM)

status = PartDoc->FeatureRevolve
( angle, reverseDir, angle2, revType )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) angle | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) reverseDir | Positive or negative angle (TRUE or FALSE) |
| Input: | (double) angle2 | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (long) revType | Type of revolution |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The revType argument can be one of the following
values:

* 0 = One-direction revolution.
* 1 = Midplane revolution. For this type of revolve,
  the angle specification specifies the full revolution. The angle to revolve
  is (angle/2 ) on either side of the sketch. The reverseDir argument has
  no affect.
* 2 = Two-direction revolution. For this type of
  revolve, the angle is the angle to revolve in Direction1 and angle2 is
  the angle to be revolved in Direction2.
