# PartDoc::GetProcessedBody

The
OLE version of this method is obsolete and has been superseded by
[Body2::GetProcessedBody](../Body2/Body2__GetProcessedBody.htm).

The
COM version of this method is obsolete and has been superseded by PartDoc::IGetProcessedBody2.

Description

This method preprocesses the geometry of a body so that:

* Closed periodic faces are split into two faces
  (for example, the lateral face of a cylinder).
* Any faces that straddle the seam of the underlying
  surface are split into two faces.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = PartDoc.GetProcessedBody ()

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to dispatch object, a body, which is a copy of the body for this part |

Syntax (COM)

status = PartDoc->IGetProcessedBody (
&retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (LPBODY) retval | Pointer to the body, which is a copy of the body for this part |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This type of preprocessing is sometimes necessary (for example, IGES)
for exporting to systems that have difficulty with periodic conditions
.
