This method inserts an existing part into this
part document.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = PartDoc.InsertPart ( fileName, ImportPlane,
ImportAxis, ImportCThread )

#

| Input: | (BSTR) fileName | Name of part file |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) ImportPlane | TRUE if the planes from the part should be imported into this part, FALSE if not |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) ImportAxis | TRUE if the axes from the part should be imported into this part, FALSE if not |
| Input | (VARIANT\_BOOL) ImportCThread | TRUE if the cosmetic threads from the part should be imported into this part, FALSE if not |
| Output: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Dispatch pointer to the inserted feature |

#

Syntax (COM)

status = PartDoc->InsertPart ( fileName, ImportPlane,
ImportAxis, ImportCThread, &retval )

| Input: | (BSTR) fileName | Name of part file |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) ImportPlane | TRUE if the planes from the part should be imported into this part, FALSE if not |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) ImportAxis | TRUE if the axes from the part should be imported into this part, FALSE if not |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) ImportCThread | TRUE if the cosmetic threads from the part should be imported into this part, FALSE if not |

Remarks

This method inserts the specified
part at the origin of this part. To position the insert part at a different
location or orientation or both, use FeatureManager::InsertMoveCopyBody2.

The interface returned by
this method is LPFEATURE, which gives you access to the Feature APIs,
such as Feature::Name to get or set the name of the feature.
