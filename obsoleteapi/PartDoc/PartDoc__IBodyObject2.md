Remarks

When working with assemblies,
you can obtain the Body2 object using Component2::IBody.

Obtaining the Body2 object
from the actual Component2 object recognizes any assembly-level changes
made to this body. For example, if an assembly-level hole was drilled
through an assembly component, then the Body2 object returned from Componen2t::IBody
contains that hole; whereas, the Body2 object returned from PartDoc::IBody
does not contain the hole. This is because this type of assembly-level
change is kept with the assembly component and is not propagated down
to the underlying part document.
