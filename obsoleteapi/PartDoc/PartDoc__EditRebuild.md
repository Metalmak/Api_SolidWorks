Remarks

Certain situations exist where this command is blocked.

For example, if the end-user is interactively editing the properties
of a face, then this method is blocked because calling it would invalidate
all the pointers in the document. If this command is not blocked, then
closing the Face, Properties dialog
might cause problems because the dialog is looking for the original face
pointer.
