| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (LPENUMBODIES) retval | Pointer to the enumerated list of bodies |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

A Reference surface feature can consist of one or more surfaces knitted
together.

Each reference surface feature has two Body objects:

* One to represent the front faces
* one to represent the back faces

Each Body object has one or more faces depending on whether the reference
surface feature is a set of knitted surfaces or a single underlying surface.
The corresponding faces for each body pair should have normal vectors
that are opposite.

To use the enumerated list, see the EnumBodies object.
