# Annotation::SetLeader

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [Annotation::SetLeader2](Annotation__SetLeader2.htm).

Description

This method sets the leader display characteristics
for this annotation.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Annotation.SetLeader ( leader, leaderSide,
smartArrowHeadStyle, bentLeader )

| Input: | (BOOL) leader | TRUE enables leader display, FALSE disables leader display |
| Input: | (long) leaderSide | Leader side as defined in swLeaderSide\_e |
| Input: | (BOOL) smartArrowHeadStyle | TRUE enables smart arrowhead style, FALSE disables smart arrowhead style |
| Input: | (BOOL) bentLeader | TRUE enables bent leader display, FALSE disables bent leader display |
| Return: | (long)retval | Indicates whether the operation succeeded (see below) |

Syntax (COM)

status = Annotation->SetLeader ( leader, leaderSide,
smartArrowHeadStyle, bentLeader, &retval )

| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) leader | TRUE enables leader display, FALSE disables leader display |
| Input: | (long) leaderSide | Leader side as defined in swLeaderSide\_e |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) smartArrowHeadStyle | TRUE enables smart arrowhead style, FALSE disables smart arrowhead style |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) bentLeader | TRUE enables bent leader display, FALSE disables bent leader display |
| Output: | (long) retval | Indicates whether the operation succeeded (see below) |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

These parameters are characteristics of the annotation,
not of individual leaders, and you can get or set them whether or not
leaders are displayed.

Use Annotation::GetLeader to determine whether
leader display is enabled or disabled.

Use Annotation::GetLeaderSide to get the leader
attachment side setting.

Use Annotation::GetSmartArrowHeadStyle to determine
whether smart arrowhead style is enabled or disabled.

Use Annotation::GetBentLeader to determine whether
bent leader display is enabled or disabled.

The return status of this operation can have the
following values:

| 0 | Leader characteristics were successfully set |
| -1 | Leader characteristics were not set because of an unknown error |
| -2 | Leader attachment side setting is invalid |
| -3 | Leaders are not supported on this type of annotation |
| -4 | Leaders cannot be disabled on this type of annotation |
| -5 | Bent leaders cannot be disabled on this type of annotation |

If leader display is enabled, this method changes
the visible model. To see those changes, the graphics window must be redrawn
using ModelDoc2::GraphicsRedraw2.
