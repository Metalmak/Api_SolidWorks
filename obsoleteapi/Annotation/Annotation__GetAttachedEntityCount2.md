of entities to which this annotation is attached.

#

Syntax (COM)

&retval)

Remarks

This method supports all annotation types. See
Annotation::GetType to determine the type of annotation.

Call this method before calling the COM versions
of Annotation::GetAttachedEntities2 or Annotation::GetAttachedEntityTypes.
Dispatch applications do not need a count method because they can use
the upper SafeArray bound from the Annotation::GetAttachedEntities2 and
Annotation::GetAttachedEntityTypes return values to determine the array
size.
