# Annotation::Select

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [Annotation::Select2](Annotation__Select2.htm).

Description

This method selects the annotation, and appends it to the selections
or replaces the entire selection list.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Annotation.Select ( appendFlag )

| Input: | (BOOL) appendFlag | TRUE if the annotation is to be appended to the selection list, FALSE if the annotation replaces the selection list |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if the annotation was selected |

Syntax (COM)

status = Annotation->Select ( appendFlag, &retval
)

| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) appendFlag | TRUE if the annotation is to be appended to the selection list, FALSE if the annotation replaces the selection list |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | TRUE if the annotation was selected |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful. |

Remarks

Use ModelDoc2::SelectByID instead of using this
method. This method does not work well when a PropertyManager page is
open or a command is running. ModelDoc2::SelectByID handles selection
correctly whether or not a command is running.
