# Annotation::GetAttachedEntities2

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by Annotation::GetAttachedEntities3.

Description

This method gets the entities
to which this annotation is attached.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Annotation.GetAttachedEntities2 ()

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (VARIANT) retval | Pointer to an array of Dispatch objects |

#

Syntax (COM)

status = Annotation->GetAttachedEntities2 ( &retval)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (VARIANT) retval | Pointer to an array of LPUNKNOWN objects |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

#

Remarks

This method now supports all annotation types.
See Annotation::GetType to determine the type of annotation.

The array returned by this function may contain
one or more objects of varying type. To determine the corresponding object
type in the Annotation::GetAttachedEntites2 array, see Annotation::GetAttachedEntityTypes.
COM applications can use QueryInterface to obtain the specific object
from the LPUNKNOWN pointer.

| Object Type | Object Returned |
| swSelFACES | Face2 |
| swSelEDGES | Edge |
| swSelVERTICES | Vertex |
| swSelSKETCHSEGS | SketchSegment |
| swSelSKETCHPOINTS | SketchPoint |
| swSelNOTHING | NULL  (annotation is dangling or unsupported) |

You can associate annotations with some items not
listed in the previous table (for example, origins). If this annotation
is attached to one or more of those entities, then SolidWorks returns
a corresponding NULL in one of the array positions and Annotation::GetAttachedEntityTypes
indicates the unsupported entity by returning a corresponding swSelNOTHING
value. COM applications that call Annotation::GetAttachedEntityCount2
include the NULL value in the total count of associated entities.

Likewise, if an annotation has become disassociated
from its geometry, then SolidWorks returns a corresponding NULL in one
of the array positions and Annotation::GetAttachedEntityTypes indicates
the dangling item by returning a corresponding swSelNOTHING value.

COM applications must call Annotation::GetAttachedEntityCount2
before calling this method. Annotation::GetAttachedEntityCount2 determines
the necessary array size in your call to Annotation::GetAttachedEntities2
and creates the list of attached entities. Dispatch applications can determine
the number of associated entities by checking the size of the SafeArray.

If this annotation is not associated with any geometry
(for example, a note without a leaderline), then SolidWorks returns an
empty array. See Return Values for details on detecting empty arrays.
