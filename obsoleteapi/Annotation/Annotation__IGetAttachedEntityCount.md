# Annotation::IGetAttachedEntityCount

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [Annotation::GetAttachedEntityCount2](Annotation__GetAttachedEntityCount2.htm).

Description

This method gets the number of items associated
with this annotation and creates a static list of elements.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

Not Available.

Syntax (COM)

status = Annotation->IGetAttachedEntityCount (
&retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (long) retval | Number of objects attached to this annotation |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful; S\_FALSE otherwise |

Remarks

You can use the list of elements created by this
method with Annotation::IGetAttachedEntities and Annotation::IGetAttachedEntityTypes.

This method supports all annotation types. See
Annotation::GetType to determine the type of annotation.

COM applications must call this method before calling
Annotation::IGetAttachedEntities or Annotation::IGetAttachedEntityTypes.
Dispatch applications do not need a count method because they can use
the upper SafeArray bound from the Annotation::GetAttachedEntities and
Annotation::GetAttachedEntityTypes return values to determine the array
size.
