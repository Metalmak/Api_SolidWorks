Remarks

This method retrieves all display dimensions, including suppressed,
hidden, and dangling dimensions, if the sheet format is visible. See Sheet::SheetFormatVisible.

SolidWorks suppresses or hides a dimension when you specifically select
a dimension and hide it, or when you select a feature and hide all dimensions.
If you need to filter out these dimensions, use Annotation::Visible to check that status.

SolidWorks returns the annotation even if it is on a layer that is not
displayed.

If annotations or any specific type of annotations are not displayed,
use ModelDoc2::GetUserPreferenceToggle to discover those situations.
