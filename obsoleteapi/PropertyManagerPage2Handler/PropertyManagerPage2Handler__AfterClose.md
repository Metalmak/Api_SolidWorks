# PropertyManagerPage2Handler::AfterClose

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [PropertyManagerPage2Handler2::AfterClose](../PropertyManagerPage2Handler2/PropertyManagerPage2Handler2__AfterClose.htm).

Description

This method is called after the page has been
closed.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void = PropertyManagerPage2Handler.AfterClose ( )

Syntax (COM)

status = PropertyManagerPage2Handler->AfterClose
( )

| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method is meant to be a post-notification
of when the page is gone. At this point, it is safer to take action, including
executing other methods.

When you run other methods from any handler other
than this method, you risk causing your PropertyManager page to close
during handling, which will likely result in a SolidWorks crash. To avoid
this risk, create your PropertyManager page as locked (see the Options
argument of SldWorks::CreatePropertyManagerPage) and design your code
to do as much work as possible in this method.
