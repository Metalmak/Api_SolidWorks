Remarks

This method is called when
your application uses a selection method, such as ModelDocExtension::SelectByID,
just as if the selection was made interactively.

An interactive box selection
causes this handler to be called once, regardless of how many items the
user selected. In other words, if your box selection causes six faces
to be selected, you will get only one call to this handler.
