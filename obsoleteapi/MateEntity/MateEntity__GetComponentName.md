# MateEntity::GetComponentName

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by MateEntity2::ComponentName.

Description

This method gets the component name in the assembly associated with
this mate entity.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = MateEntity.GetComponentName
()

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (BSTR) retval | Name of the component  being referenced by this MateEntity; the component name is in relation to the assembly that owns this particular mate |

Syntax (COM)

status = MateEntity->GetComponentName(
&retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (BSTR) retval | Name of the component that is being referenced by this MateEntity; the component name is in relation to the assembly that owns this particular mate |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The component name returned is in relation to the assembly that owns
this mate entity.

For example, a typical assembly might be created with the following
components. The component names are as they might appear in the FeatureManager
design tree.

 Assem1

 |

 --- Part1-1

 |

 --- Part1-2

 |

 --- Assem2-1

  |

  --- Part1-1

  |

  --- Part3-1

If there was a mate between Part1-1 and Part1-2 of Assem1, then the
component names returned for the MateEntity objects would be /Part1-1
and /Part1-2. If you also had a mate between Part1-1 of Assem1 and Part1-1
of Assem2-1, then the component names returned for the MateEntity objects
would be /Part1-1 and /Assem2-1/Part1-1. Each component name in any given
assembly is unique because it includes the relative path to any subassembly
components (for example, /Assem2-1/Part1-1).

When this particular mate is between a component and an assembly-level
feature, then MateEntity::GetComponentName returns a NULL string for the
component that contains the assembly-level feature. This only occurs when
the assembly-level feature is in the same assembly as the mate. If the
mate is between a component and an assembly-level feature in a subassembly,
then the subassembly component name is returned.

To get to the MateEntity interface used with this method, use Mate::GetMateEntities.
