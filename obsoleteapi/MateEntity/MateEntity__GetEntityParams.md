# MateEntity::GetEntityParams

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by MateEntity2::EntityParams.

Description

This method returns the parameters of this particular mate entity. Use
MateEntity::GetEntityType to know what parameters to expect.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = MateEntity.GetEntityParams
()

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray; this is an array of doubles representing the mate entity parameters |

Syntax (COM)

status = MateEntity->IGetEntityParams
( retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (double\*) retval | Pointer to an array of doubles |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The return value is the following array of doubles:

[ pointX,
pointY, pointZ, vectorI, vectorJ, vectorK, radius1, radius2 ]

 where

* pointX is the X location of this mate
  entity in the assembly model space
* pointY is the Y location of this mate
  entity in the assembly model space
* pointZ is the Z location of this mate
  entity in the assembly model space
* vectorI is the i component of the assembly
  mate vector
* vectorJ is the j component of the assembly
  mate vector
* vectorK is the k component of the assembly
  mate vector
* radius1 is the value for the first
  radius
* radius2 is the value for the second
  radius

To define the mate entity, the following information is returned based
upon the mate type. All coordinate information is given in terms of the
assembly coordinate system where the mate resides.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Mate Type | Returned |
| swMatePoint | pointX, pointY, pointZ |
| swMateLine | pointX, pointY, pointZ, vectorI, vectorJ, vectorK where the point is a point on the line and the vector represents the line direction. |
| swMatePlane | pointX, pointY, pointZ, vectorI, vectorJ, vectorK where the point is a point on the plane and the vector represents the plane normal. |
| swMateCylinder | pointX, pointY, pointZ, vectorI, vectorJ, vectorK, radius1 where the point is a point on the cylinder axis and the vector represents the cylinder axis. |
| swMateCone | pointX, pointY, pointZ, vectorI, vectorJ, vectorK, radius1, radius2 where the point is a point on the cone axis and the vector represents the cone axis. |
