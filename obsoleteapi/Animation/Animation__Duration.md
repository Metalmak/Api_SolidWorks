This property gets the
length of time, in seconds, this animation plays.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

Remarks

Animation::Speed affects
the duration of the animation. Animation::Speed allows you to specify
whether or not to play the animation at half speed or double speed, which
halves or doubles the animation duration.

If you use Animation::Duration
while an animation is playing, then you may not get the same result as
when the animation is not running.

| If you get the Animation object using... | And then use... | Then the duration... |
| Simulation::Animation | Animation::Duration | Is at the normal playing speed |
| Simulation::PlayAnimation | Animation::Duration | May be a different value because the animation is playing and the Animation Controller speed may be set to Normal, Slow Play, or Fast Play |
