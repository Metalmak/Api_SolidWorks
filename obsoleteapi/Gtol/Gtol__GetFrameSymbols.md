# Gtol::GetFrameSymbols

This method is obsolete and has been superseded by
Gtol::GetFrameSymbols2 and Gtol::GetFrameDiameterSymbols.

Description

This method returns an array describing the symbols that appear in the
first or second feature control frame of this Gtol.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= Gtol.GetFrameSymbols ( frameNumber)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (short) frameNumber | Frame number |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray |

Syntax (COM)

status
= Gtol->IGetFrameSymbols ( frameNumber, retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (short) frameNumber | Frame number |
| Output: | (short\*) retval | Array of shorts |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Each symbol returned by this method is identified by an integer index
that you can use as the symIdx argument with the GetSym\* methods.

Format of return information is the following array of short integers:

retval[0] = gcs, Geometric characteristic
symbol index

retval[1] = tdia1, Indicates whether the
first gtol tolerance has a "diameter" symbol

retval[2] = tmc1, Index of material condition
symbol for first tolerance value

retval[3] = tdia2, Indicates whether the
second gtol tolerance has a "diameter" symbol

retval[4] = tmc2, Index of material condition
symbol for first tolerance value

retval[5] = dmc1, Index of material condition
symbol for datum1

retval[6] = dmc2, Index of material condition
symbol for datum2

retval[7] = dmc3, Index of material condition
symbol for datum3

(GCS), see swGtolGeomCharSymbol\_e.

For valid Material Conditions (tolMC1,
tolMC2, datumMC1, and so on), see swGtolMatCondition\_e.
