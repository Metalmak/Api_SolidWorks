# Gtol::GetLeaderAtIndex

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by Gtol::GetLeaderAtIndex2.

Description

This
method gets information about the specified leader on this Gtol.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= Gtol.GetLeaderAtIndex ( index )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) index | Index of the leader |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray (see Remarks) |

Syntax (COM)

status
= Gtol->IGetLeaderAtIndex ( index, &PointCount, retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) index | Index of the leader |
| Output: | (long) PointCount | Number of (x,y,z) points returned in the array |
| Output: | (double\*) retval | Pointer to array of doubles (see Remarks) |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

There can be 0, 1 or 2 lines with the leader line.
If the Gtol is not attached, then there are 0 lines. Otherwise, the gtol
can have a straight leaderline (1 line) or a bent leaderline (2 lines).
The caller must infer the number of leader lines based on Gtol::IsAttached
and Gtol::HasExtraLeader.

* IsAttached()
  == FALSE implies no leaderline and there are therefore no leaderline points
  (PointCount=0).
* HasExtraLeader()
  == FALSE means that this is a straight leaderline and there will therefore
  be 1 line (PointCount=2).
* HasExtraLeader()
  == TRUE means that this is a bent leaderline and there will therefore
  be 2 lines (PointCount=3).

The format of return information is the following
array of doubles:

* retval[0]
  = X-coordinate of first leader point
* retval[1]
  = Y-coordinate of first leader point
* retval[2]
  = Z-coordinate of first leader point
* retval[3]
  = X-coordinate of second leader point
* retval[4]
  = Y-coordinate of second leader point
* retval[5]
  = Z-coordinate of second leader point
* retval[6]
  = X-coordinate of third leader point
* retval[7]
  = Y-coordinate of third leader point
* retval[8]
  = Z-coordinate of third leader point

Use Gtol::GetLeaderCount to see how many leaders
are on the Gtol object.
