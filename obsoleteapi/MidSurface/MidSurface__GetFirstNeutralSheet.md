# MidSurface::GetFirstNeutralSheet

This method is obsolete
and has been superseded by MidSurface2::GetFirstNeutralSheet.

Description

This method return the first reference surface in this MidSurface feature.
Each reference surface in the MidSurface feature is considered a sheet
body. If the reference surfaces are sewn together during the creation
of the MidSurface feature (ModelDoc::InsertMidSurfaceExt), then the MidSurface
feature will contain only one reference surface sheet body.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = MidSurface.GetFirstNeutralSheet
()

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to a Dispatch object, the first reference surface sheet body in this MidSurface feature |

Syntax (COM)

status = MidSurface->IGetFirstNeutralSheet
( &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (LPBODY) retval | First reference surface sheet body in this MidSurface feature |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The sheet body returned from this method has the normal topology that
you would expect to find on a body object (for example, faces, edges,
and so on). See the Body object for the methods that provide access to
this topology.
