# MidSurface::GetNeutralSheetCount

This method is obsolete
and has been superseded by MidSurface2::GetNeutralSheetCount.

Description

This method determines the total number of reference surfaces found
in this MidSurface feature. Each reference surface in the MidSurve feature
is considered a sheet body. If the reference surfaces are sewn together
during the creation of the MidSurface feature (ModelDoc::InsertMidSurfaceExt),
then the MidSurface feature will contain only one reference surface sheet
body.
