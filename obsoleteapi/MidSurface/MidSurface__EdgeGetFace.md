# MidSurface::EdgeGetFace

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by MidSurface2::EdgeGetFace.

Description

This method takes the specified mid-surface edge and returns the body
face on which this edge lies. This condition occurs when a reference surface
extends to meet one of the faces on the original part body. If the edge
specified does not lie on one of the original part body faces, then a
NULL is returned.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = MidSurface2.EdgeGetFace (
edgeInDisp)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (LPDISPATCH) edgeInDisp | Pointer to a Dispatch object, a MidSurface edge |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to a Dispatch object, a face on the original solid body |

Syntax (COM)

status = MidSurface2->IEdgeGetFace
( edgeInDisp, &retval )

| Input: | (LPEDGE) edgeInDisp | Pointer to a MidSurface edge |
| Output: | (LPFACE) retval | Pointer to a face on the original solid body |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This edge is not topologically related to the face returned.
