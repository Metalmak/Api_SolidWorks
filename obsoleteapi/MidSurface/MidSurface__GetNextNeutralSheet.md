# MidSurface::GetNextNeutralSheet

This method is obsolete
and has been superseded by MidSurface2::GetNextNeutralSheet.

Description

This method returns the next reference surface in this MidSurface feature.
Each reference surface in the MidSurface feature is considered a sheet
body. If the reference surfaces are sewn together during the creation
of the MidSurface feature (ModelDoc::InsertMidSurfaceExt), then the MidSurface
feature will contain only one reference surface sheet body. If this is
the case, then this method returns NULL. The first and only reference
surface sheet body should have been returned with the MidSurface::GetFirstNeutralSheet
method.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = MidSurface.GetNextNeutralSheet
()

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to a Dispatch object, the next reference surface sheet body in this MidSurface feature |

Syntax (COM)

status = MidSurface->IGetNextNeutralSheet
( &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (LPBODY) retval | Next reference surface sheet body in this MidSurface feature |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The sheet body returned from this method has the normal topology that
you would expect to find on a body object (for example, faces, edges,
and son). See the Body object for the methods that provide access to this
topology.
