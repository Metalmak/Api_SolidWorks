# MidSurface::GetNextFace

This method is obsolete
and has been superseded by MidSurface2::GetNextFace.

Description

This method is used in combination with MidSurface::GetFirstFace. Each
time this method is called, it returns subsequent faces in this MidSurface
feature.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = MidSurface.GetNextFace ( fromFace1Disp,
fromFace2Disp, thickness)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (LPDISPATCH) fromFace1Disp | Pointer to a Dispatch object, a face on the original part body used in generating the neutral face |
| Output: | (LPDISPATCH) fromFace2Disp | Pointer to a Dispatch object, a face on the original part body used in generating the neutral face |
| Output: | (double) thickness | Distance between the two parallel faces, Face1 and Face2 |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to a Dispatch object, a face in this MidSurface feature |

Syntax (COM)

status = MidSurface->IGetNextFace
( fromFace1Disp, fromFace2Disp, thickness, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (LPFACE) fromFace1Disp | Pointer a face on the original part body used in generating the neutral face |
| Output: | (LPFACE) fromFace2Disp | Pointer a face on the original part body used in generating the neutral face |
| Output: | (double) thickness | Distance between the two parallel faces, Face1 and Face2 |
| Output: | (LPFACE) retval | Face in this MidSurface feature |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method returns the next neutral face in this MidSurface feature
along with three other items. The first two return values are the two
faces from the original part body that were used to generate this neutral
MidSurface face. The next return value is the thickness (in meters) between
the two parallel faces from the original part body. The last return value
is the neutral face in this MidSurface feature.
