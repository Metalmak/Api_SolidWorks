# MidSurface::GetFirstFacePair

This method is obsolete
and has been superseded by MidSurface2::GetFirstFacePair.

Description

This method returns the first face pair in this MidSurface feature along
with the thickness (in meters) between the two faces. The two face objects
returned are the two parallel faces from the original part body that were
used to generate the first neutral face in this MidSurface feature.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = MidSurface.GetFirstFacePair
( &thickness, &partnerFaceDisp)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (double) thickness | Distance between the two parallel faces, from Face1 and from Face2 |
| Output: | (LPDISPATCH) partnerFaceDisp | Pointer to a Dispatch object, a face on the original part body used in generating the neutral face |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to a Dispatch object, a face on the original part body used in generating the neutral face |

Syntax (COM)

status = MidSurface->IGetFirstFacePair
( &thickness, &partnerFaceDisp, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (double) thickness | Distance between the two parallel faces, fromFace1 and fromFace2 |
| Output: | (LPFACE) partnerFaceDisp | Pointer to a face on the original part body used in generating the neutral face |
| Output: | (LPFACE) retval | Pointer to a face on the original part body used in generating the neutral face |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method is identical to MidSurface::GetFirstFace except this method
does not return the neutral face.
