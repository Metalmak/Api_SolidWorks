Remarks

Using this method, you can select temporary bodies.
You can then assign colors to faces on temporary bodies and to entire
temporary bodies using Face2::MaterialPropertyValues and Body2::MaterialPropertyValues2,
respectively. To determine if a body is temporary, call Body2::IsTemporaryBody.

If you specify swTempBodySelectable for the option
argument, then the blocking state is set to swModifyBlock. The blocking
state is unset after Body2::Hide is called.
