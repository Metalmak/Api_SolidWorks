# Body2::DraftBody

This body is obsolete and has been superseded
by Body2::DraftBody2.

Description

This method adds a draft angle to a set of
faces on a temporary body. This method modifies the body.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Body2.DraftBody ( numOfEnts,
faceList, edgeList, draftAngle, dir )

| Input: | (long) numOfEnts | Number of faces to draft |
| Input: | (VARIANT) faceList | List of pointers to the faces |
| Input: | (VARIANT) edgeList | List of pointers to the reference edges, one for each face, along which the draft is applied |
| Input: | (double) draftAngle | Draft angle |
| Input: | (VARIANT) dir | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x,y,z), a vector which specifies the direction of the draft |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if draft successfully applied, FALSE if not |

Syntax (COM)

status = Body2->IDraftBody ( numOfEnts, faceList,
edgeList, draftAngle, dir, &retval )

| Input: | (long) numOfEnts | Number of faces to draft |
| Input: | (LPFACE\*) faceList | List of pointers to the faces |
| Input: | (LPEDGE\*) edgeList | List of pointers to the reference edges, one for each face, along which the draft is applied |
| Input: | (double) draftAngle | Draft angle |
| Input: | (double\*) dir | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z), a vector which specifies the direction of the draft |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | TRUE if draft successfully applied, FALSE if not |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |
