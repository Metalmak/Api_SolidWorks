# Body2::GetProcessedBody

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by Body2::GetProcessedBody2.

Description

This method pre-processes the geometry of a body so that:

* Closed periodic faces (for example, the lateral
  face of a cylinder) are split into two faces.
* Faces that straddle the seam, if any, of the underlying
  surface are split into two faces.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Body2.GetProcessedBody ( )

| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to dispatch object, a body; this body is a processed copy of the body for this part |

Syntax (COM)

status = Body2->IGetProcessedBody
( &retval )

| Output: | (LPBODY2) retval | Pointer to the body; this body is a processed copy of the body for this part |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful. |

Remarks

Pre-processing (for example, IGES) is sometimes necessary for exporting
to systems that have difficulty with periodic conditions.
