# Body2::Display

This method is obsolete and superseded by
[Body2::Display2](Body2__Display2.htm).

Description

This method displays a temporary body object in the context of the specified
part.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void Body2.Display ( part, color)

| Input: | (LPDISPATCH) part | Pointer to Dispatch object, the part |
| Input: | (long) color | Part color |

Syntax (COM)

status = Body2->IDisplay ( part,
color )

| Input: | (LPPARTDOC) part | Pointer to the part |
| Input: | (long) color | Part color |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

While SolidWorks is displaying your body object using Body2::Display,
do not release it explicitly or implicitly. Before releasing or allowing
the Body2 object to be released, call Body2::Hide to prevent it from being
displayed.

COM applications can call Body2->Release() to avoid explicitly releasing
the Body2 object while it is being displayed.

Dispatch applications should avoid:

* allowing the Body2 object to go out of scope while
  it is being displayed.
* explicitly releasing the Body2 object by calling
  ReleaseDispatch while it is being displayed by SolidWorks.
