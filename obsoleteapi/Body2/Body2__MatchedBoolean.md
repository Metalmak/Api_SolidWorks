# Body2::MatchedBoolean

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [Body2::MatchedBoolean3](Body2__MatchedBoolean3.htm).

Description

This method performs a matched boolean on the
specified faces.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Body2.MatchedBoolean ( operationType, toolBody,
numOfMatchingFaces, faceList1, faceList2, errorCode )

#

| Input: | (int) operationType | One of the following operation types:   * SWBODYADD * SWBODYCUT * SWBODYINTERSECT |
| Input: | (LPDISPATCH) toolBody | Pointer to the tool body |
| Input: | (long) numOfMatchingFaces | Number of matching faces |
| Input: | (VARIANT) faceList1 | First face list |
| Input: | (VARIANT) faceList2 | Second face list |
| Output: | (long) errorCode | Error indicator as defined in swBodyOperationError\_e |
| Output: | (VARIANT) retval | SafeArray containing a set of LPDISPATCH pointers for the resulting matches |

#

Syntax (COM)

status = Body2->IMatchedBoolean ( operationType,
toolBody, numOfMatchingFaces, faceList1, faceList2, &errorCode, &retval
)

| Input: | (int) operationType | One of the following operation types:   * SWBODYADD * SWBODYCUT * SWBODYINTERSECT |
| Input: | (LPBODY) toolBody | Pointer to the tool body |
| Input: | (long) numOfMatchingFaces | Number of matching faces |
| Input: | (LPFACE\*) faceList1 | First face list |
| Input: | (LPFACE\*) faceList2 | Second face list |
| Output: | (long) errorCode | Error indicator as defined in swBodyOperationError\_e |
| Output: | (LPENUMBODIES) retval | Pointer to an EnumBodies2 object for the resulting matches |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |
