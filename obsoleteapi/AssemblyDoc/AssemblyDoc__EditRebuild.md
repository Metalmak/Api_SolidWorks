# AssemblyDoc::EditRebuild

This method is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::EditRebuild3.

Description

This method rebuilds the assembly.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void AssemblyDoc.EditRebuild ()

Syntax (COM)

status = AssemblyDoc->EditRebuild
( )

| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

There are certain instances where SolidWorks prohibits this command.
For example, if the user is interactively editing the properties of a
face, then SolidWorks prohibits this method because calling it would invalidate
all of the pointers in the document. If this method is not blocked, then
closing the Face-Properties dialog might cause problems because the dialog
box is looking for the original face pointer.
