# AssemblyDoc::InsertCavity3

This method is obsolete and has been superseded by
AssemblyDoc::InsertCavity4.

Description

This method inserts a cavity to the active
part using a selected component.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void AssemblyDoc.InsertCavity3 ( scaleFactor,
scaleType, keepPieceIndex)

| Input: | (double) scaleFactor | Scaling factor |
| Input: | (long) scaleType | Type of scaling |
| Input: | (long) keepPieceIndex | Piece to keep if there is ambiguity |

Syntax (COM)

status = AssemblyDoc->InsertCavity3
( scaleFactor, scaleType, keepPieceIndex )

| Input: | (double) scaleFactor | Scaling factor |
| Input: | (long) scaleType | Type of scaling |
| Input: | (long) keepPieceIndex | Piece to keep if there is ambiguity |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This operation is performed in the context of an
assembly document. The component being edited in the context of the assembly
will receive the new cavity feature.

Set the scaleFactor parameter appropriately for
your casting material. Express the scaling factor as a percent (+/- 20%)
of the size of the cavity part, passing a value between -20 and +20.

The formula used to determine the size of the cavity is:

cavitysize = partsize \* (1 + scaleFactor/100)

The scaleType parameter specifies the type of scaling. Options include:

| 0 | About component ventroids |
| 1 | About component origins |
| 2 | About mold base origin |

When there is ambiguity in the result of a cut,
keepPieceIndex is used to resolve which of the possible results is used.
You can set this to -1 if there is no ambiguity; otherwise, it should
be the index of the result (a value between 0 and 1 less than the possible
number of outcomes).
