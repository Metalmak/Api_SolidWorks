# AssemblyDoc::AddMate

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [AssemblyDoc::AddMate2](AssemblyDoc__AddMate2.htm).

Description

This
method adds an assembly component mate relationship.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void AssemblyDoc.AddMate ( mateType,
align, flip, dist, angle)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) mateType | Type of mate as defined in swMateType\_e |
| Input: | (long) align | Type of alignment as defined in swMateAlign\_e |
| Input: | (BOOL) flip | TRUE to flip the component, FALSE otherwise |
| Input: | (double) dist | Distance value used with swMateDISTANCE mate type |
| Input: | (double) angle | Angle value used with swMateANGLE mate type |

Syntax (COM)

status = AssemblyDoc->AddMate (
mateType, align, flip, dist, angle )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) mateType | Type of mate as defined in swMateType\_e |
| Input: | (long) align | Type of alignment as defined in swMateAlign\_e |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) flip | TRUE to flip the component, FALSE otherwise |
| Input: | (double) dist | Distance value used with swMateDISTANCE mate type |
| Input: | (double) angle | Angle value used with swMateANGLE mate type |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method replaces MateAdd, MateAngle, MateOffset,
MateSame, and MateOn.

If mateType is swMateDISTANCE or swMateANGLE
when the mate is applied to the closest position that meets the mate condition
specified by dist or angle, then setting flip to TRUE jumps the assembly
to the other possible mate position.
