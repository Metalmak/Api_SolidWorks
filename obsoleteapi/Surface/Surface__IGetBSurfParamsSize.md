# Surface::IGetBSurfParamsSize

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [Surface::IGetBSurfParamsSize2](Surface__IGetBSurfParamsSize2.htm).

Description

This method gets the allocation size necessary for Bsurface parameter
data retrieval in a subsequent call to Surface::GetBSurfParams.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

Not available.

Syntax (COM)

status = Surface->IGetBSurfParamsSize
( wantCubicRational, Range, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) wantCubicRational | TRUE if you want surface to be a cubic rational, FALSE otherwise |
| Input: | (double\*) Range | Pointer to an array of 4 doubles describing the U,V Range; these four values are upper and lower U and V bounds, respectively; these values can be obtained using Surface::Parameterization |
| Output: | (long) retval | Size of the data set |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Range contains the following values which can be obtained using Surface::Parameterization:

* Range[0] & Range[2] are
  the lower bounds of the U & V surface parameters, respectively.
* Range[1] & Range[3] are
  the upper bounds of the U & V surface parameters, respectively.
