# PropertyManagerPage2Handler3::OnComboboxEditChanged

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [PropertyManagerPage2Handler4::OnComboboxEditChanged](../PropertyManagerPage2Handler4/PropertyManagerPage2Handler4__OnComboboxEditChanged.htm).

Description

This method is called when
a user changes the text string in the text box of a combo box.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void = PropertyManagerPage2Handler3.OnComboboxEditChanged
( Id, Text )

#

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) Id | ID of the combo box |
| Input: | (BSTR) Text | Text string |

#

Syntax (COM)

status = PropertyManagerPage2Handler3->OnComboboxEditChanged
( Id, Text )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) Id | ID of combo box |
| Input: | (BSTR) Text | Text string |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

#

Remarks

This method is only called
if the combo box was set up as an editable text box. If the combo box
is set up to as a static text box, then this method is not called.

Use this method along with
the PropertyManagerPage2Handler3::OnComboxSelectionChanged method to find
out what is in the text box of the combo box, if the user can edit the
text in the text box.

When this method is called,
the control may not yet be updated with the current selection, so the
PropertyManagerPageCombobox::CurrentSelection property is not reliable.
The text passed into this method is the up-to-date text.
