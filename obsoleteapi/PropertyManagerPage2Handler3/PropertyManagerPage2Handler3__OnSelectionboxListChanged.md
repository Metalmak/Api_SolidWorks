Remarks

This method is called when
your application uses a selection method, such as ModelDocExtension::SelectByID2,
just as if the selection was made interactively.

The method is called during
the process of SolidWorks selection.  It
is neither a pre-notification or post-notification.  The
add-in should not be taking any action that may affect the model or the
selection list. The add-in should only be querying information, presumably
about the state of selections to set up its own information correctly.

Regardless of how many items
the user selects, this method is called only once per interactive box
selection. In other words, if the user selects six faces using a box selection,
this method is called only once.
