Remarks

This method is meant to be a post-notification
of when a page is closed. At this point, it is safer to take action, including
executing other methods. The PropertyManagerPage2Handler3::OnClose method
is intended to be a pre-notification of when a page is going to close.
At this point, before the page is closed, you can collect the information
that is currently on the page and save it.

When you run other methods from any handler other
than PropertyManagerPage2Handler3::AfterClose, you risk causing your PropertyManager
page to close during handling, which will most likely result in a SolidWorks
crash. To avoid this risk, create your PropertyManager as locked (see
the Options argument of SldWorks::CreatePropertyManagerPage) and design
your code to do as much work as possible in the PropertyManagerPage2Handler3::AfterClose
method.
