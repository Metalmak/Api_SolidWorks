# Simulation::Duration

This
property is:

* obsolete and has not been
  superseded.
* nonfunctional in SolidWorks
  2008 and later.

  Use the interfaces related to motion studies introduced in SolidWorks
  2008 to access animation and simulation.

Description

This property gets the
elapsed time of the Physical Simulation.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

Retval = Simulation.Duration (VB Get
property)

Retval = Simulation.GetDuration ( ) (C++ Get property)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (double) Retval | Elapsed time in seconds |

#

Syntax (COM)

status = Simulation->get\_Duration
( &Retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (double) Retval | Elapsed time in seconds |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

#

Remarks

If the Physical Simulation
has not yet been calculated, then Retval is 0.0.

The return value represents
the length of time that the simulation is expected to last. This means
that if a bouncing ball takes 15 seconds to come to a stop, then this
property returns a value of 15.
