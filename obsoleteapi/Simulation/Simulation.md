# Simulation Object

This interface
is:

* obsolete and has not been
  superseded.
* nonfunctional in SolidWorks
  2008 and later.

  Use the interfaces related to motion studies introduced in SolidWorks
  2008 to access animation and simulation.

Allows access to the data that defines a Physical Simulation, which
is the Simulation folder that
is created when you create Physical Simulation elements such as linear
or rotary motors, springs, and gravity in an assembly document.

NOTE: Do not confuse Physical
Simulation with animation. The SolidWorks software computes a Physical
Simulation, which generates a number of steps (and transforms) and elapsed
time for those steps. The SolidWorks software then displays the computed
Physical Simulation using animation. To create the display, the animation
process takes the Physical Simulation steps and does a linear interpolation
of those steps for the elapsed time. The elapsed time and frames of Physical
Simulation will most likely be different than the elapsed time and frames
of an animation.
