# Simulation::ResetComponents

This
method is:

* obsolete and has not been
  superseded.
* nonfunctional in SolidWorks
  2008 and later.

  Use the interfaces related to motion studies introduced in SolidWorks
  2008 to access animation and simulation.

Description

This method resets the components
to the positions and orientations they were in prior to creating the Physical
Simulation.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

Retval = Simulation.ResetComponents ()

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) Retval | TRUE if the components' positions and orientations are reset, FALSE if not |

#

Syntax (COM)

status = Simulation->ResetComponents ( &Retval)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) Retval | TRUE if the components' positions and orientations are reset, FALSE if not |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |
