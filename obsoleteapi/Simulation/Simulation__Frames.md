# Simulation::Frames

This
property is:

* obsolete and has not been
  superseded.
* nonfunctional in SolidWorks
  2008 and later.

  Use the interfaces related to motion studies introduced in SolidWorks
  2008 to access animation and simulation.

Description

This property gets the
number of steps, or frames, in the Physical Simulation.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

Retval = Simulation.Frames (VB Get property)

Retval = Simulation.GetFrames ( ) (C++
Get property)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (long) Retval | Number of steps |

#

Syntax (COM)

status = Simulation->get\_Frames
( &Retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (long) Retval | Number of steps |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

#

Remarks

If the Physical Simulation
is not yet calculated, then Retval is 0.0.
