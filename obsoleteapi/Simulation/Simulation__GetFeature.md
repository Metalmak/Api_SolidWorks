# Simulation::GetFeature

This method is:

* obsolete and has not been
  superseded.
* nonfunctional in SolidWorks
  2008 and later.

  Use the interfaces related to motion studies introduced in SolidWorks
  2008 to access animation and simulation.

Description

This method gets the feature
that provides you access to the Physical Simulation.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

Retval = Simulation.GetFeature ()

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (LPFEATURE) Retval | Pointer to the Feature object |

#

Syntax (COM)

status = Simulation->GetFeature ( &Retval)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (LPFEATURE) Retval | Pointer to the Feature object |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

#

Remarks

After using this method to
get the feature, use either of the following methods to get the Simulation
interface:

* Feature::GetSpecificFeatue2
* AssemblyDoc::GetSimulation
