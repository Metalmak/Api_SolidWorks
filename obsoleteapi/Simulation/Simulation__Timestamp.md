# Simulation::Timestamp

This
property is:

* obsolete and has not been
  superseded.
* nonfunctional in SolidWorks
  2008 and later.

  Use the interfaces related to motion studies introduced in SolidWorks
  2008 to access animation and simulation.

Description

This property gets the
unique time stamp for this Physical Simulation.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

Retval = Simulation.Timestamp (VB Get
property)

Retval = Simulation.GetTimestamp ( )
(C++ Get property)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (long) Retval | Time stamp for this Physical Simulation (see Remarks) |

#

Syntax (COM)

status = Simulation->get\_Timestamp
( &Retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (long) Retval | Time stamp for this Physical Simulation (see Remarks) |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

#

Remarks

| If a... | Then... |
| New Physical Simulation is calculated | The time stamp (Retval) changes |
| Physical Simulation does not exist or it was deleted | 0 is returned |
| Physical Simulation was created using SolidWorks 2005 or earlier | -1 is returned |
