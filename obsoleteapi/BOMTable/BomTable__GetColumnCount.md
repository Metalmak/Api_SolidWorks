# BomTable::GetColumnCount

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by BomTable::GetTotalColumnCount.

Description

This method gets the number of columns in the BOM table.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = BomTable.GetColumnCount ()

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (long) retval | Number of columns in the BOM table |

Syntax
(COM)

status = BomTable->GetColumnCount
( &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (long) retval | Number of columns in the BOM table |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method only returns the visible columns in the BOM table.

Before you use any of the BomTable methods, you must first activate
the BOM Table using [BomTable::Attach](BomTable__Attach.htm).
After you finish getting BOM data, use BomTable::Detach to deactivate
the table.

This method returns 0 if the BOM is obscured, which may occur when debugging
a macro. This is a quirk in Microsoft Excel, which is used by SolidWorks
for the BOM functionality.
