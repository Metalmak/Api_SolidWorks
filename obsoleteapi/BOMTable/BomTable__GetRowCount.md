# BomTable::GetRowCount

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by BomTable::GetTotalRowCount.

Description

This method gets the number of rows in the BOM table.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = BomTable.GetRowCount ()

| Return: | (long) retval | Number of rows in the BOM table |

Syntax
(COM)

status = BomTable->GetRowCount (
&retval )

| Output: | (long) retval | Number of rows in the BOM table |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method only returns the visible rows in the BOM table.

Before you use any of the BomTable methods, activate the BOM Table using
[BomTable::Attach](BomTable__Attach.htm). After you finish
getting BOM data, use BomTable::Detach to deactivate the table.

This method returns 0 if the BOM is obscured, which may occur when debugging
a macro. This is a quirk in Microsoft Excel, which is used by SolidWorks
for the BOM functionality.
