# Curve::GetBCurveParams

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by Curve::GetBCurveParams3.

Description

This
method gets the parameters of the curve.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= Curve.GetBCurveParams ( wantCubicIn)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BOOL) wantCubicIn | TRUE returns cubic rational parameters, FALSE does not |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray describing the parameters of the curve |

Syntax (COM)

status
= Curve->IGetBCurveParams ( retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (double\*) retval | Pointer to an array of doubles describing the parameters of the curve |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

For COM implementations, see Curve::IGetBCurveParamsSize2 to determine
the size of the array returned and whether the curve data returned by
Cure::IGetBCurveParams is cubic rational or not.

To control the accuracy of the curve data, see Modeler::SetToleranceValue.

The return value retval is an array of doubles. The array size is (
2 + numKnots + numControlPointDoubles) where numKnots is (numControlPoints
+ order). The array is as follows:

[
packedDouble1, packedDouble2,
knot1, knot2,...,
ControlPoint1[Dimension],
ControlPoint2[Dimension],...
]

where:

* packedDouble1
  is an integer pair containing the Dimension
  and Order
* packedDouble2
  is an integer pair containing the NumControlPoints
  and Periodicity
* knot1
* knot2

...

* ControlPoint1[dimension]
* ControlPoint2[dimension]

...

The size of the control
point array is based on the curve dimension:

* If Dimension
  = 3, then ControlPoint is an
  array of 3 doubles ( x, y, z )
* If Dimension
  = 4, then ControlPoint is an
  array of 4 doubles ( x, y, z, w ) where w = weight
