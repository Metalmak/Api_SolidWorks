| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

the model into a rollback state to allow access to the selections that
define the simple fillet feature. You must use SimpleFilletFeatureData::ReleaseSelectionAccess
to restore the rollback state unless you call Feature::ModifyDefinition.
