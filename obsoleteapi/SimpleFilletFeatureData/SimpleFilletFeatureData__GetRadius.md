Remarks

To obtain a pointer to a fillet Item, see SimpleFilletFeatureData::GetFilletItemAtIndex
and the SimpleFilletFeatureData::FilletItemsCount. Fillets can be made
from multiple edges or faces and these methods get a pointer to any of
the entities that helped to create the particular fillet and pass it into
pFilletItem of this method.
