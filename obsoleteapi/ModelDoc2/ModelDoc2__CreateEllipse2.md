# ModelDoc2::CreateEllipse2

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by SketchManager::CreateEllipse.

Description

This method creates an ellipse using the specified
center point and points.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc2.CreateEllipse2 ( centerX, centerY,
centerZ, majorX, majorY, majorZ, minorX, minorY, minorZ )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) centerX | X values for the ellipse center point |
| Input: | (double) centerY | Y values for the ellipse center point |
| Input: | (double) centerZ | Z values for the ellipse center point |
| Input: | (double) majorX | X values for a point on the ellipse and on the major axis |
| Input: | (double) majorY | Y values for a point on the ellipse and on the major axis |
| Input: | (double) majorZ | Z values for a point on the ellipse and on the major axis |
| Input: | (double) minorX | X values for a point on the ellipse and on the minor axis |
| Input: | (double) minorY | Y values for a point on the ellipse and on the minor axis |
| Input: | (double) minorZ | Z values for a point on the ellipse and on the minor axis |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to the Dispatch object of the ellipse that was created |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->ICreateEllipse2 ( centerX,
centerY, centerZ, majorX, majorY, majorZ, minorX, minorY, minorZ, &retval
)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) centerX | X values for the ellipse center point |
| Input: | (double) centerY | Y values for the ellipse center point |
| Input: | (double) centerZ | Z values for the ellipse center point |
| Input: | (double) majorX | X values for a point on the ellipse and on the major axis |
| Input: | (double) majorY | Y values for a point on the ellipse and on the major axis |
| Input: | (double) majorZ | Z values for a point on the ellipse and on the major axis |
| Input: | (double) minorX | X values for a point on the ellipse and on the minor axis |
| Input: | (double) minorY | Y values for a point on the ellipse and on the minor axis |
| Input: | (double) minorZ | Z values for a point on the ellipse and on the minor axis |
| Output: | (LPSKETCHSEGMENT) retval | Pointer to the newly created ellipse |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method creates an ellipse in the active 2D
sketch. If a sketch is not active, then a new sketch is  created.
You can check for an active sketch using ModelDoc2::GetActiveSketch2.

| Application | Objects |
| OLE | You can define a new ISketchSegment or ISketchEllipse object using the returned Dispatch pointer. Visual Basic applications interpret the pointer for you automatically, so you can use the returned object to call SketchSegment or SketchEllipse functions. |
| COM | The object pointer returned from this method can be used to call any APIs on the SketchSegment interface. The underlying SketchEllipse object can be obtained using QueryInterface on the returned SketchSegment object. |

ModelDoc2::SetAddToDB and ModelDoc2::SetDisplayWhenAdded
increase performance during entity creation by adding entities directly
to the SolidWorks database.

ModelDoc2::SetAddToDB avoids some of the peculiarities
involved with creating entities via the user interface, such as inferencing,
automatic relations, and snapping to the grid. Adding entities directly
to the database also increases the performance of this method. When you
are done creating entities, restore ModelDoc2::SetAddToDB(False)to its
normal operating mode.

This method also works with ModelDoc2::SetDisplayWhenAdded.
If you called ModelDoc2::SetAddToDB(True), additional performance can
be gained by calling ModelDoc2::SetDisplayWhenAdded(False) to disable
immediate display of entities as they are added to the database. When
you are done creating all of your sketch entities, you must redraw your
document window (see ModelDoc2::GraphicsRedraw2) to see the entities you
added. You should also restore the original display settings by calling
ModelDoc2::SetDisplayWhenAdded(True).

To create a partial ellipse, use ModelDoc2::CreateEllipticalArcByCenter.
