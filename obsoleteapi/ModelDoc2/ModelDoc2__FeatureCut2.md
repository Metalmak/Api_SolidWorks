# ModelDoc2::FeatureCut2

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc2::FeatureCut3](ModelDoc2__FeatureCut3.htm).

Description

This method create a cut feature.

Remarks

The default direction for cut operations is opposite the sketch normal.
The default direction for boss operations is along the sketch normal.
Setting the dir argument to TRUE reverses the default direction. For double-ended
extrusions, Direction2 is always opposite to Direction1.

The default sketch normal is the same as the face or plane normal where
the sketch was placed. To determine this normal vector, see Face::Normal
and RefPlane::GetRefPlaneParams, respectively.

When there is ambiguity as the result of a cut, the keepPieceIndex is
used to resolve which of the possible results is used. This can be set
to -1 if there is no ambiguity; otherwise, it should be the index of the
result, starting from 0 (up to 1 less than the possible number of outcomes.)
