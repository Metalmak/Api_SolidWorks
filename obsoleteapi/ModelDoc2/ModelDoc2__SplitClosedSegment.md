# ModelDoc2::SplitClosedSegment

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by SketchManager::SplitClosedSegment.

Description

This method splits the selected sketch segment
into two sketch segments.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc2.SplitClosedSegment ( x1, y1, z1, x2,
y2, z2 )

| Input: | (double) x1 | X value of first point |
| Input: | (double) y1 | Y value of first point |
| Input: | (double) z1 | Z value of first point |
| Input: | (double) x2 | X value of second point |
| Input: | (double) y2 | Y value of second point |
| Input: | (double) z2 | Z value of second point |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->SplitClosedSegment ( x1, y1,
z1, x2, y2, z2 )

| Input: | (double) x1 | X value of first point |
| Input: | (double) y1 | Y value of first point |
| Input: | (double) z1 | Z value of first point |
| Input: | (double) x2 | X value of second point |
| Input: | (double) y2 | Y value of second point |
| Input: | (double) z2 | Z value of second point |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The selected sketch segment must be a closed entity
(for example, the start and end points must be the same). To split a closed
sketch segment (for example, a complete circle) into two pieces, you must
specify two points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2).
