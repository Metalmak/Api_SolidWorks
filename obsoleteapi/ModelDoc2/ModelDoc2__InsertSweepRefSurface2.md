# ModelDoc2::InsertSweepRefSurface2

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [FeatureManager::InsertSweepSurface](../FeatureManager/FeatureManager__InsertProtrusionSwept2.htm).

Description

This method creates a reference surface by sweeping the selected profile
along the selected sweep curves. Because you are creating a surface, the
sections can be open.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

(void) ModelDoc2.InsertSweepRefSurface2
( propagate, twistCtrlOption, keepTangency, forceNonRational, startMatchingType,
endMatchingType )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) propagate | If TRUE, then the sweep propagates to the next edge, FALSE causes the sweep to occur only on the selected edge; to propagate to the next edge, the next edge must be tangent to the current edge |
| Input: | (short) twistCtrlOption | Twist control options:   * 0   = Follow path * 1   = Keep constant normal * 2   = Follow path and first guide curve * 3   = Follow first and second guide curve |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) keepTangency | Follow path |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) forceNonRational | Keep constant normal |
| Input: | (short) startMatchingType | Start tangency type:   * 0   - none * 1   - tangent to the normal of the profile * 2   - tangent to a selected vector * 3   - tangency to all the adjacent faces sharing an edge with the start profile * 4   - tangent to some of the selected faces sharing an edge with the start   profile (not yet available) |
| Input: | (short) endMatchingType | End tangency type:   * 0   - none * 1   - tangent to the normal of the profile * 2   - tangent to a selected vector * 3   - tangency to all the adjacent faces sharing an edge with the start profile * 4   - tangent to some of the selected faces sharing an edge with the start   profile (not yet available) |

| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Use ModelDocExtension::SelectByID to select
the profile and sweep curves with these marks:

* 1 = profile selection
* 4 = sweep path
* 2 = guide curve selection,  if
