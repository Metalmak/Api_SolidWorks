# ModelDoc2::InsertSheetMetalBaseFlange

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by FeatureManager::InsertSheetMetalBaseFlange.

Description

This method inserts a sheet metal base flange
feature into a selected sketch or an active sketch.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

voidModelDoc2.InsertSheetMetalBaseFlange ( thickness,
thickenDir, radius, extrudeDist1, extrudeDist2, flipExtruDir, endCondition1,
endCondition2, dirToUse)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) thickness | Wall thickness of the sheet metal feature |
| Input: | (BOOL) thickenDir | Direction to thicken the sheet metal |
| Input: | (double) radius | Global bend radius to insert at the corners |
| Input: | (double) extrudeDist1 | Distance of the sheet metal extrusion for the Direction1 |
| Input: | (double) extrudeDist2 | Distance of the sheet metal extrusion for the Direction2 |
| Input: | (BOOL) flipExtruDir | Reverse extrude direction |
| Input: | (long) endCondition1 | End condition for first extrude distance |
| Input: | (long) endCondition2 | End condition for second extrude distance |
| Input: | (long) dirToUse | Type of end condition |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->InsertSheetMetalBaseFlange
( thickness, thickenDir, radius, extrudeDist1, extrudeDist2, flipExtruDir,
endCondition1, endCondition2, dirToUse)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) thickness | Wall thickness of the sheet metal feature |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) thickenDir | Direction to thicken the sheet metal |
| Input: | (double) radius | Global bend radius to insert at the corners |
| Input: | (double) extrudeDist1 | Distance of the sheet metal extrusion for the Direction1 |
| Input: | (double) extrudeDist2 | Distance of the sheet metal extrusion for the Direction2 |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) flipExtruDir | Reverse extrude direction |
| Input: | (long) endCondition1 | End condition for first extrude distance |
| Input: | (long) endCondition2 | End condition for second extrude distance |
| Input: | (long) dirToUse | Type of end condition |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

| Argument | Description |
| thickenDir | Refers to the direction that the profile is offset; thus, the thickness of the resulting sheet metal flange. TRUE thickens to the inside; FALSE  thickens to the outside. |
| flipExtruDir | Refers to the direction the extrude distance goes from the sketch plane. If this value is TRUE, the direction is reversed from the default direction. |
| endCondition1 and endCondition2 | * 0   - use the distance * 1   - extrude up to a point * 2   - extrude up to a surface   For a midplane distance, endCondition1 and endCondition2 should be equal and each half the desired distance. |
| dirToUse | Refers to which direction to use.   * 0   - use both directions * 1   - use the first direction * 2   - use the second direction |
