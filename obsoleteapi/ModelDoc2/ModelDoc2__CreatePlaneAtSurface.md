# ModelDoc2::CreatePlaneAtSurface

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc2::CreatePlaneAtSurface2](ModelDoc2__CreatePlaneAtSurface2.htm).

Description

This method creates create a reference plane
tangent (or normal) to a surface.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc2.CreatePlaneAtSurface ( interIndex,
projOpt, reverseDir, normalPlane, angle )

| Input: | (int) interIndex | * Multiple   intersections - other solutions may exist * Surface,   plane, and edge - the intersection index is the intersection point to   use when there are multiple intersections; when the intersection index   input is more than the number of intersection points, the index of the   last intersection point found will be used |
| Input: | (BOOL) projOpt | TRUE to project the sketch plane point along the sketch plane normal when a sketch point and a surface, FALSE to project the sketch plane point normal to the surface |
| Input: | (BOOL) normalPlane | TRUE to find the plane normal to the surface for a conical surface, FALSE to find the plane tangent to the surface |
| Input: | (double) angle | Value of the angular offset of the normal plane, relative to a chosen reference plane |

Syntax (COM)

projOpt, reverseDir, normalPlane, angle )
