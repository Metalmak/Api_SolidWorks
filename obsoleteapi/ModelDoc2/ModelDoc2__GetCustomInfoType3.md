Remarks

File custom information is stored in the document
file. It can be general to the file, in which case there is a single value
whatever the models configuration, or it can be configuration specific,
in which case a different value may be set for each configuration in the
model.

To access a general custom information value, set
the configuration argument to be an empty string.
