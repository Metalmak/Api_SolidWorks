# ModelDoc2::CreateSpline

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by SketchManager::CreateSpline.

Description

This method creates a spline passing through
the given points.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc2.CreateSpline ( pointData )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT) pointData | Set of X,Y,Z point coordinates to use in creating the spline (see Remarks) |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to the Dispatch object of the newly created spline |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->ICreateSpline ( pointCount,
pointData, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) pointCount | The number of points in the pointData array |
| Input: | (double\*) pointData | Set of X,Y,Z point coordinates to use in creating the spline (see Remarks) |
| Output: | (LPSKETCHSEGMENT) retval | Pointer to the newly created spline |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method creates a spline in the active 2D sketch.
If a sketch is not active, then a new sketch is created. Use ModelDoc2::GetActiveSketch2
to check if the sketch active.

The pointData array is a set of, at least, two
X, Y, Z values. The X value for the start point of the spline is pointData[0],
the Y value for the start point is pointData[1], and the Z value for the
start point is pointData[2]. The X value for the next point is pointData[3],
and so on. For the COM interface, the total number of points in the array
must be passed in. For the OLE interface, the total number of points are
determined automatically, by taking the UBound of the pointData VARIANT
and dividing by 3, so be careful to dimension that array correctly.

For COM applications, you can use the object pointer
returned from this method to call any APIs on the SketchSegment interface.
You can obtain the underlying SketchSpline object by using QueryInterface
on the returned SketchSegment object.

OLE applications can define a new SketchSegment
or SketchSpline object using the returned Dispatch pointer. Visual Basic
applications interpret the pointer for you automatically, so you can use
the returned object to call SketchSegment or SketchEllipse APIs.

This method does not work with ModelDoc2::SetAddToDB
or ModelDoc2::SetDisplayWhenAdded. It always adds the spline directly
to the database (as if ModelDoc2::SetAddToDB(True) was in effect), and
you must redraw your document window to see the entities that you added
(as if ModelDoc2::SetDisplayWhenAdded(False) was in effect).

In 2D sketches, SolidWorks ignores the Z value
in pointData.
