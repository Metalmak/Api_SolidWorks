# ModelDoc2::CustomInfo2

This method
is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDocExtension::CustomPropertyManager.

Description

This property gets and sets the file custom information for the SolidWorks
document.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

value = ModelDoc2.CustomInfo2 (configuration,
fieldName) (VB Get property)

ModelDoc2. CustomInfo2(configuration,
fieldName) = value (VB Set property)

value = ModelDoc2.GetCustomInfo2(configuration,
fieldName) (C++ Get property)

ModelDoc2.SetCustomInfo2(configuration,
fieldName, value) (C++ Set property)

| Input: | (BSTR) configuration | Name of the configuration (see Remarks) |
| Input: | (BSTR) fieldName | Name of field |
| Property: | (BSTR) value | Text in the field |

Syntax (Com)

status = ModelDoc.get\_CustomInfo2(configuration,
fieldName, &value) (C++ Get property)

status = ModelDoc.put\_CustomInfo2(configuration,
fieldName, value) (C++ Set property)

| Input: | (BSTR) configuration | Name of the configuration (see Remarks) |
| Input: | (BSTR) fieldName | Name of field |
| Property: | (BSTR) value | Text in the field |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

File custom information is stored in the document
file. It can be:

* General to
  the file, in which case there is a single value whatever the model's configuration
  - or -
* Configuration-specific,
  in which case a different value may be set for each configuration in the
  model

To access a general custom information value, set
the configuration argument to an empty string. To get a document-level
property, pass an empty string ("") to the configuration argument.

As per Microsoft recommendations for OLE support, the file summary information
for SolidWorks documents is written as an OLE property set into a stream
named "\005Summary Information" off the root storage of the
SolidWorks document's compound file.

NOTE: MFC does not currently
provide classes that manage summary information. However, the DRAWCLI
application shipped with Visual C++ includes a sample implementation,
in the form of the class CSummInfo, that you can use as an example when
implementing your own. This class is used by the document class CDrawDoc.
DRAWCLI also includes property pages for displaying and modifying Summary
Information.

The mechanism to do this is similar to the sample code to retrieve the
SolidWorks preview bitmap, which is available on the SolidWorks Web site
at http://www.solidworks.com/pages/services/APIDownloads.html. Download
