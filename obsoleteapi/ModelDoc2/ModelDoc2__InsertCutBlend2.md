# ModelDoc2::InsertCutBlend2

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc2:InsertCutBlend3](ModelDoc2__InsertCutBlend3.htm).

Description

This method inserts a lofted cut based on the selected profiles and
guide curves. Selection of guide curves is optional; however, selection
of the profiles must be in an order consistent with the desired direction
of the loft.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc2.InsertCutBlend2
( closed, keepTangency, forceNonRational)

| Input: | (BOOL) closed | TRUE for a closed loft, FALSE for an open loft; if TRUE, and if you have selected less that three profiles, then any selected guide curves must be closed curves |
| Input: | (BOOL) keepTangency | If the section curves are tangent, then you have the option to specify whether the resulting surfaces are also be tangent; specify TRUE to maintain the tangency as seen in the section curves, FALSE otherwise; when generating tangent surfaces, planar and cylindrical surface shapes are maintained if the section curves exhibit these characteristics |
| Input: | (BOOL) forceNonRational | TRUE to force the resulting surface to be non-rational, FALSE otherwise |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->InsertCutBlend2
( closed, keepTangency, forceNonRational )

| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) closed | TRUE for a closed loft, FALSE for an open loft; if TRUE, and if you have selected less that three profiles, then any selected guide curves must be closed curves |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) keepTangency | If the section curves are tangent, then you have the option to specify whether the resulting surfaces are also be tangent; specify TRUE to maintain the tangency as seen in the section curves, FALSE otherwise; when generating tangent surfaces, planar and cylindrical surface shapes are maintained if the section curves exhibit these characteristics |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) forceNonRational | TRUE to force the resulting surface to be non-rational, FALSE otherwise |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Use of guide curves is recommended especially when selection of profiles
is done in the FeatureManager design tree.

You can use any number of profiles; however, if you selected less that
three profiles, then any selected guide curves must be closed curves.

Use ModelDocExtension::SelectByID to select
the profiles and guide curves. The mark
for:

* profile selections should be a 1.
* any guide curve selection, if provided, should
  be a 2.
