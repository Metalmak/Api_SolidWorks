# ModelDoc2::FeatureCutThin

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [ModelDoc2::FeatureCutThin2](ModelDoc2__FeatureCutThin2.htm).

Description

This method creates a feature
by extruding a profile. A constant thickness is applied to the profile
during extrusion. The result is then removed from the existing work piece.

| Input: | (BOOLEAN) offsetReverse2 | TRUE specifies offset in direction away from the sketch if you chose to offset the first second condition from another face or plane, FALSE specifies offset from the face or plane in a direction toward the sketch |
| Input: | (double) thk1 | Wall thickness 1 (midplane type uses (thk1)/2 for each direction) |
| Input: | (double) thk2 | Wall thickness 2 (only used when thinType = 3) |
| Input: | (double) capThk | End cap thickness (only used when capEnds = 1) |
| Input: | (long) thinType | Thin feature type:   * 0   = one direction * 1   = one direction reverse * 2   = midplane * 3   = two direction |
| Input: | (long) capEnds | Cap the ends:   * 0   = no cap * 1   = cap (base features only) |

Remarks

The default direction for cut operations is opposite the sketch normal.
The default direction for boss operations is along the sketch normal.
Setting the dir argument to TRUE reverses the default direction. For double-ended
extrusions, Direction 2 is always opposite to Direction 1.

The default sketch normal is the same as the face or pPlane normal where
the sketch was placed. To determine this normal vector, see Face::Normal
and RefPlane::GetRefPlaneParams, respectively.
