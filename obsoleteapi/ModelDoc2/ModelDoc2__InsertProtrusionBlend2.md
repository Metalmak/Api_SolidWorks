# ModelDoc2::InsertProtrusionBlend2

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [ModelDoc2::InsertProtrusionBlend3](ModelDoc2__InsertProtrusionBlend3.htm).

Description

This method creates a lofted body or boss from the selected profiles
and guide curves. Selection of guide curves is optional; however, selection
of the profiles must be in an order consistent with the desired direction
of the loft.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc2.InsertProtrusionBlend2
( closed, keepTangency, forceNonRational)

| Input: | (BOOL) closed | TRUE for closed loft, FALSE for open loft; if TRUE, and if you have selected less that three profiles, then any selected guide curves must be closed curves |
| Input: | (BOOL) keepTangency | If the section curves are tangent, then you have the option to specify whether the resulting faces are also tangent; specify TRUE to maintain the tangency as seen in the section curves, FALSE otherwise; when generating tangent surfaces, SolidWorks maintain planar and cylindrical surface shapes if the section curves exhibit these characteristics |
| Input: | (BOOL) forceNonRational | TRUE to force the resulting surface to be non-rational, FALSE otherwise |

Syntax
(COM)

status = ModelDoc2->InsertProtrusionBlend2
( closed, keepTangency, forceNonRational )

| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) closed | TRUE for closed loft, FALSE for open loft; if TRUE, and if you have selected less that three profiles, then any selected guide curves must be closed curves |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) keepTangency | If the section curves are tangent, then you have the option to specify whether the resulting faces are also tangent; specify TRUE to maintain the tangency as seen in the section curves, FALSE otherwise; when generating tangent surfaces, SolidWorks maintain planar and cylindrical surface shapes if the section curves exhibit these characteristics |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) forceNonRational | TRUE to force the resulting surface to be non-rational; FALSE otherwise |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Use of guide curves is recommended, especially when selection of profiles
is done in the FeatureManager design tree. You can use any number of profiles;
however, if you have selected less that three profiles, then any selected
guide curves must be closed curves. Use ModelDocExtension::SelectByID
to select the profiles and guide curves. The mark
for the profile selections should be a 1; the mark for any guide
curve selection, if provided, should be a 2.
