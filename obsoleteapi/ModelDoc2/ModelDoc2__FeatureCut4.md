# ModelDoc2::FeatureCut4

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [ModelDoc2::FeatureCut5](ModelDoc2__FeatureCut5.htm).

Description

This method creates a cut feature in this model
document.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc2.FeatureCut4 ( sd, flip, dir, t1, t2,
d1, d2, dchk1, dchk2, ddir1, ddir2, dang1, dang2, offsetReverse1, offsetReverse2,
keepPieceIndex, normalCut)

| Input: | (BOOL) sd | TRUE for single-ended, FALSE for double-ended |
| Input: | (BOOL) flip | Flip side to cut; TRUE if you want to remove the material outside of the profile |
| Input: | (BOOL) dir | Reverse direction; TRUE if you want Direction 1 to be opposite the default direction |
| Input: | (long) t1 | Termination type for first end as defined in swEndConditions\_e |
| Input: | (long) t2 | Termination type for second end as defined in swEndConditions\_e |
| Input: | (double) d1 | Depth of extrusion for first end in meters |
| Input: | (double) d2 | Depth of extrusion for second end in meters |
| Input: | (BOOL) dchk1 | TRUE allows draft angle in first direction, FALSE does not allow drafting |
| Input: | (BOOL) dchk2 | TRUE allows draft angle in second direction, FALSE does not allow drafting |
| Input: | (BOOL) ddir1 | TRUE for first draft angle to be inward, FALSE for draft angle outward |
| Input: | (BOOL) ddir2 | TRUE for second draft angle to be inward, FALSE for draft angle outward |
| Input: | (double) dang1 | Draft angle for first end |
| Input: | (double) dang2 | Draft angle for second end |
| Input: | (BOOL) offsetReverse1 | If you chose to offset the first end condition from another face or plane, then TRUE would specify offset in direction away from the sketch and FALSE would specify offset from the face or plane in a direction toward the sketch. |
| Input: | (BOOL) offsetReverse2 | If you chose to offset the second end condition from another face or plane, then TRUE would specify offset in direction away from the sketch and FALSE would specify offset from the face or plane in a direction toward the sketch. |
| Input: | (long)keepPieceIndex | Which piece to keep if there is ambiguity, see below. |
| Input: | (BOOL) normalCut | TRUE uses the normal cut option, FALSE does not  This parameter applies only to sheet metal parts. Non-sheet metal parts should use FALSE. When adding a cut to the folded sheet metal part, you can set this parameter to TRUE to ensure that the cut is created normal to the sheet metal thickness. |

Remarks

The default direction for Cut operations are opposite
the sketch normal. The Default direction for Boss operations is along
the sketch normal. Setting the "Dir" argument to TRUE will reverse
the default direction. For double-ended extrusions, "Direction 2"
will always be opposite to "Direction 1".

The default sketch normal will be the same as the
Face or Plane normal where the sketch was placed. To determine this normal
vector, refer to Face2::Normal and RefPlane::GetRefPlaneParams respectively.

When there is ambiguity in the result of a cut,
the KeepPieceIndex is used to resolve which of the possible results is
used. This can be set to -1 if there is no ambiguity, otherwise it should
be the index of the result, starting from 0 (up to one less than the possible
number of outcomes.)
