# ModelDoc2::FeatureFillet3

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [ModelDoc2::FeatureFillet4](ModelDoc2__FeatureFillet4.htm).

Description

This method creates a fillet feature.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc2.FeatureFillet3 ( r1, propagate, ftyp, varRadTyp, overFlowType, nRadii,
radii, useHelpPoint, useTangentHoldLine )

| Input: | (double) r1 | Radius for end1 |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) propagate | TRUE to propagate the blend, FALSE to not |
| Input: | (int) ftyp | * 0   - simple fillet * 1   - variable radius fillet * 2   - surface blend |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) varRadTyp | * 0   - linear * 1   - smooth transition ( variable radius) |
| Input: | (long) overFlowType | Control of fillet overflowing onto adjacent surfaces |
| Input: | (int) nRadii | Number of radii for variable radius fillets |
| Input: | (VARIANT) radii | SafeArray containing the radii for variable radius fillets |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) useHelpPoint | TRUE to use help points, FALSE to not |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) useTangentHoldLine | TRUE to use tangent hold line, FALSE to not |
| Return: | (long)res | 1 if the fillet is created, 0 if not |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->IFeatureFillet3 ( r1, propagate,
ftyp, varRadTyp, overFlowType, nRadii, radii, useHelpPoint, useTangentHoldLine,
&retval )

| Input: | (double) r1 | Radius for end1 |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) propagate | TRUE to propagate the blend, FALSE to not |
| Input: | (int) ftyp | * 0   - simple fillet * 1   - variable radius fillet * 2   - surface blend |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) varRadTyp | * 0   - linear * 1   - smooth transition ( variable radius) |
| Input: | (long) overFlowType | Control of fillet overflowing onto adjacent surfaces |
| Input: | (int) nRadii | Number of radii for variable radius fillets |
| Input: | (double\*) radii | Array containing the radii for variable radius fillets |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) useHelpPoint | TRUE to use help points, FALSE to not |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) useTangentHoldLine | TRUE to use tangent hold line, FALSE to not |
| Output: | (long) res | 1 if the fillet was created, 0 if not |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The overFlowType argument controls how the fillet
behaves when it meets adjacent surfaces:

* 0 - Default - The system
  picks the appropriate method to create a fillet when the fillet surface
  overflows to adjacent surfaces. It either smoothly blends with adjacent
  surfaces or limits the fillet surface with the adjacent edges
  (thus, not changing the edge) or trims the fillet surface by the adjacent
  surface onto which the fillet overflows. The method that is used by default
  depends on the geometric condition. This option always tries to create
  a fillet, if possible.
* 1 - Keep Edge - The
  edges that are overflowed by the fillet are not modified. The fillet surface
  is trimmed by all the adjacent edges. As a result, an additional transition
  fillet surface might be needed to complete the fillet.
* 2 - Keep Surface - The
  fillet surface is either merged with the adjacent surfaces smoothly or
  trimmed by the adjacent surfaces. As a result, it is unlikely that an
  additional transition fillet surface will be created.

For face blend fillets, select the first set of
faces with mark 2 and the second set of faces with mark 4.
