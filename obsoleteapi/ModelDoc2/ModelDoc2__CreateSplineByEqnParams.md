# ModelDoc2::CreateSplineByEqnParams

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by SketchManager::CreateSplineByEqnParams.

Description

This method creates a B-curve from B-spline
data; that is, a set of B-spline vertices (control points) and a knot
vector. The curve can be either periodic or non-periodic.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc2.CreateSplineByEqnParams ( paramsIn )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT) paramsIn | SafeArray containing an array of doubles to use in creating the spline |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to the Dispatch object of the newly created spline |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->ICreateSplineByEqnParams (
propArray, knotsArray, cntrlPntCoordArray, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (int\*) propArray | Includes dimension, order, number of control points, periodicity |
| Input: | (double\*) knotsArray | knot1, knot2, and so on |
| Input: | (double\*) cntrlPntCoordArray | controlpoint1[dimension], controlpoint2[dimension], and so on |
| Output: | (LPSKETCHSEGMENT) retval | Pointer to the newly created spline |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The propArray array contains four integers (placed
in the first four doubles in the SafeArray):

* Dimension
* Order
* Number of
  Control Points
* Periodicity
  ( TRUE or FALSE )

The knotsArray contains doubles with (Number of
Control Points + Order) elements.

The size of the cntrlPntCoordArray array is based
upon the curve dimension.

* Dimension
  = 2 then each Control Point is an array of 2 doubles ( x, y )
* Dimension
  = 3 then each Control Point is an array of 3 doubles ( x, y, z)
* Dimension
  = 4 then each Control Point is an array of 4 doubles ( x, y, z, w ) where
  w = weight

The parameters are provided as three arrays, which
for OLE automation are packed into a single SafeArray, which is packed
as follows:

[ Dimension,
Order, Number of control Points, Periodicity, knot1, knot2,...,ControlPoint1[Dimension],
ControlPoint2[Dimension],... ]

Pass the control point coordinates to this routine
in sketch space. The Z value is  interpreted
as 0. In certain situations, you must transform your B-curve parameters
to sketch space using Sketch::ModelToSketchTransform.

NOTE: If
the generated spline is a closed spline, then it must be flagged as periodic.
Additionally, splines generated in sketches must be G1 continuous. If
the data passed to this method does not generate a G1 continuous spline,
then it is rejected and a spline is not created. If your data is not G1
continuous, then you must split the spline into multiple G1 segments and
call this method for each segment.

For the OLE interface, you can use the returned
object pointer directly to call any APIs on the SketchSpline interface
or its base class, SketchSegment. For the COM interface, you can use the
returned object pointer directly to call any APIs on the SketchSegment
interface, or use QueryInterface to obtain the pointer to the SketchSpline
and any APIs on the SketchSpline interface.

This method does not work with ModelDoc2::SetAddToDB
or ModelDoc2::SetDisplayWhenAdded. It always adds the spline directly
to the database (as if ModelDoc2::SetAddToDB(True) is in effect), and
you must redraw your document window to see the entities that you added
(as if ModelDoc2::SetDisplayWhenAdded(False) is in effect).

and related functions.
