# ModelDoc2::CreateFeatureMgrView3

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by ModelViewManager::CreateFeatureMgrView2.

Description

This method creates a new FeatureManager design
tree view. This method also provides a parameter for adding a tab, which
the user clicks to activate your view.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc2.CreateFeatureMgrView3 ( bitmap, toolTip, whichPane )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long\*) bitmap | Pointer to the bitmap you wish to use for the FeatureManager design tree tab. The bitmap should be no larger than 16x18. This standard pointer is created by performing a New on CBitmap |
| Input: | (BSTR) toolTip | ToolTip string |
| Input: | (long) whichPane | Pane to add the view as defined by swFeatMgrPane\_e |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to a Dispatch object, the FeatMgrView created |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->ICreateFeatureMgrView3 ( bitmap,
toolTip, whichPane, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long\*) bitmap | Pointer to the bitmap you wish to use for the FeatureManager design tree tab. The bitmap should be no larger than 16x18. This standard pointer is created by performing a New on CBitmap |
| Input: | (BSTR) toolTip | ToolTip string |
| Input: | (long) whichPane | Pane to add the view as defined by swFeatMgrPane\_e |
| Output: | (LPFEATMGRVIEW) retval | pointer to the FeatMgrView created |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful, S\_FALSE if the view was not created |

Remarks

This method is identical to the earlier version, ModelDoc2::CreateFeatureMgrView2,
except that this method provides the ability to place your newly created
Feature Manager tab on either the top or bottom pane. The pane may or
may not be visible. However, the tab is added to the specified pane.

Under certain conditions, for example while the
Surface, Extend command is active
in the user interface, SolidWorks locks the bottom pane and does not allow
the activation of any other tab. If your application needs the ability
to activate your new tab at all times, consider adding it either to the
top pane or to both panes. If you add it to the top pane only, it may
not be apparent to the user until the top pane is made visible.

If you receive a non-NULL return value, you can use FeatMgrView::GetFeatMgrViewWnd
to get the new view handle. Because the view created is empty, you can
use the new view handle in combination with standard MFC calls to draw,
as desired, into the view.

The FeatureManager design tree view added to this document is not persistent.
In other words, the FeatureManager design tree view is not stored with
this document and must be recreated upon reloading the document.

This method automatically sets up to receive FeatMgrView::ActivateNotify
and DeactivateNotify events. On the appropriate notification, you can
call ModelDoc2::DeleteFeatureMgrView to clean up and delete your view.
