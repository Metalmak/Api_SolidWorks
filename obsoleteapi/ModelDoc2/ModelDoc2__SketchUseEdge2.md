# ModelDoc2::SketchUseEdge2

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by SketchManager::SketchUseEdge.

Description

This method uses the selected edges to generate geometry in the active
sketch.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc2.SketchUseEdge2 ( chain )

| Input: | (BOOL) chain | TRUE if you want entire chain of entities offset, FALSE if you want only selected sketch entities offset (see Remarks) |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if the offset is successful, FALSE if not |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->SketchUseEdge2 ( chain, &retval
)

| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) chain | TRUE if you want entire chain of entities offset, FALSE if you want only selected sketch entities offset (see Remarks) |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | TRUE if the offset is successful, FALSE if not |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Specifying TRUE to the chain argument offsets the
selected entity and any other entities that belong to the same contour
or chain (contiguous, geometric entities like edges).

See ModelDoc2::SketchOffsetEntities2 method for
similar functionality.
