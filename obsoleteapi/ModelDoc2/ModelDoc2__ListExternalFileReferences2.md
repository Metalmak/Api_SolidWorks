# ModelDoc2::ListExternalFileReferences2

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by ModelDocExtension::ListExternalFileReferences.

Description

This method gets the names and statuses of
the external file references on this model.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void = ModelDoc2.ListExternalFileReferences2 ( modelPathName,
componentPathName, feature, dataType, Status, refEntity, featCom )

#

| Output: | (VARIANT) \*modelPathName | Array of external parts' or assemblies' paths and names |
| Output: | (VARIANT) \*componentPathName | Array of configurations of the referenced components to use for derived parts |
| Output: | (VARIANT) \*feature | Array of in-context items (sketches, features, and so on) in the selected part |
| Output: | (VARIANT) \*dataType | Array of data used to create the items (converted edge or face, converted or offset sketch entity, body, and so on) |
| Output: | (VARIANT) \*Status | Status of external reference as defined in swExternalReferenceStatus\_e |
| Output: | (VARIANT) \*refEntity | Array of actual items being used and the names of the documents that contain the items |
| Output: | (VARIANT) \*featCom | Array of the names of the components in which the affected features exist; this information is only displayed when one or more refEntity is in a different component in an assembly; this does not apply to derived parts |

#

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->IListExternalFileReferences2
( numRefs, modelPathName, compPathName, feature, dataType, Status, refEntity,
featComp )

| Input: | (long) numRefs | Number of external references |
| Output: | (BSTR\*) modelPathName | Array of external parts' or assemblies' paths and names of size numRefs |
| Output: | (BSTR\*) compPathName | Array of configurations of the referenced components to use for derived parts of size numRefs |
| Output: | (BSTR\*) feature | Array of in-context items (sketches, features, and so on) in the selected part of size numRefs |
| Output: | (BSTR\*) dataType | Array of data used to create the items (converted edge or face, converted or offset sketch entity, body, and so on) of size numRefs |
| Output: | (long\*) Status | Status of external reference as defined in swExternalReferenceStatus\_e |
| Output: | (BSTR\*) refEntity | Array of actual items being used and the names of the documents that contain the items of size numRefs |
| Output: | (BSTR\*) featComp | Array of the names of the components in which the affected features exist of size numRefs; this information is only displayed when one or more refEntity is in a different component in an assembly; this does not apply to derived parts |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Call ModelDoc2::ListExternalFileReferencesCount2
before calling the COM version of this method to determine the size of
the array required.
