# ModelDoc2::Save2

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by ModelDoc2::Save3.

Description

This method saves the document using its current
name.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc2.Save2 ( silent
)

| Input: | (BOOL) silent | TRUE if you want to avoid error and warning dialogs, FALSE if you want the dialogs displayed to the user |
| Return: | (long) retval | 0 for no error or a bitwise OR of the errors encountered; see swFileSaveError\_e for a list of possible errors and warnings |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->Save2 ( silent, &retval
)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BOOL) silent | TRUE if you want to avoid error and warning dialogs, FALSE if you want the dialogs displayed to the user |
| Output: | (long) retval | 0 for no error or a bitwise OR of the errors encountered; see swFileSaveError\_e for a list of possible errors and warnings |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

If the file was saved successfully, then retval has the value 0; otherwise,
it contains a bitwise OR of the error codes that were generated when saving
the document. The masks to check against are the values of the enumerator
swFileSaveError\_e.

This method results in FileSaveNotify being sent
to any application listening.

If this is an unsaved document, or saved to
a file with a new name, see ModelDoc2::SaveAs.
