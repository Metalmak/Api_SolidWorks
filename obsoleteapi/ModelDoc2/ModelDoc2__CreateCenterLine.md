# ModelDoc2::CreateCenterLine

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by SketchManager::CreateCenterLine.

Description

This method creates a center line from P1 to P2.

NOTE:  Use
ModelDoc2::CreateCenterLineVB for Visual Basic and other forms of Basic
that do not support SafeArrays.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc2.CreateCenterLine
( P1, P2)

| Input: | (VARIANT) P1 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x1, y1, z1) in meters that describe the first point of the line |
| Input: | (VARIANT) P2 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x2, y2, z2) in meters that describe the second point of the line |
| Return: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | TRUE if success, FALSE if failure |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->ICreateCenterLine
( P1, P2 )

| Input: | (double\*) P1 | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z) in meters that describe the line start point |
| Input: | (double\*) P2 | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z) in meters that describe the line start point |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

You can also create centerline construction geometry
using ModelDoc2::CreateLine2 and SketchSegment::ConstructionGeometry.
