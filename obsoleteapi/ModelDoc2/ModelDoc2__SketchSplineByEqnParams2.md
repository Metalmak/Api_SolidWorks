# ModelDoc2::SketchSplineByEqnParams2

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by SketchManager::CreateSplineByEqnParams.

Description

This method creates a spline on the active 2D sketch using the specified
b-curve parameters.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc2.SketchSplineByEqnParams2
( paramsIn )

| Input: | (VARIANT) paramsIn | VARIANT of type SafeArray containing an array of doubles (see Remarks) |
| Return: | (BOOLEAN) retval | TRUE if created successfully, FALSE if not |

Syntax (COM)

Not available. See ModelDoc2::SketchSplineByEqnParams.

Remarks

The parameters are provided as 3 arrays, which for OLE automation are
packed into a single SafeArray packed as follows:

[
Dimension, Order, Number of control
Points, Periodicity, knot1, knot2,...,ControlPoint1[Dimension], ControlPoint2[Dimension],...
]

Pass control point coordinates to this method in sketch space. The Z
value is interpreted as 0. In certain situations, you must transform your
b-curve parameters to sketch space with the help of Sketch::ModelToSketchTransform.

NOTE: If the spline being generated
is a closed spline, then it must be flagged as periodic. In addition,
splines generated in sketches must be G1 continuous. If the data passed
to this method does not generate a G1 continuous spline, then it is rejected
and a spline is not created. If your data is not G1
continuous, then you must split the spline into multiple G1 segments and
call method for each segment.
