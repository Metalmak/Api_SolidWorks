# ModelDoc2::FeatureRevolve2

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by FeatureManager::FeatureRevolve.

Description

This method creates a revolved feature. This feature is either a base
feature or boss feature.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc2.FeatureRevolve2
( angle, reverseDir, angle2, revType, Options)

| Input: | (double) angle | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (BOOL) reverseDir | TRUE if angle is positive, FALSE if negative |
| Input: | (double) angle2 | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (long) revType | Type of revolution |
| Input: | (long) Options | Additional control as defined in swAutoCloseSketch |
| Return: | (long) retval | 0 for no error, 1 for error |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->FeatureRevolve2(
angle, reverseDir, angle2, revType, Options, &retval )

| Input: | (double) angle | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) reverseDir | TRUE if angle is positive, FALSE if negative |
| Input: | (double) angle2 | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (long) revType | Type of revolution |
| Input: | (long) Options | Additional control as defined in swAutoCloseSketch |
| Output: | (long) retval | 0 if no error, 1 if error |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The revType argument can be one of the following values:

* 0 = One-direction revolution.
* 1 = MidPlane revolution. For this type of revolve,
  the angle argument specifies the full revolution. The angle to revolve
  is (angle/2) on either side of the sketch. The reverseDir argument has
  no effect.
* 2 = Two-direction revolution. For a two-direction
  revolve, the angle argument is the angle to revolve in Direction 1 and
  angle2 is the angle to be revolved in Direction 2.
