# ModelDoc2::InsertMfDraft

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [ModelDoc2::InsertMfDraft2](ModelDoc2__InsertMfDraft2.htm).

Description

This method creates a multi-face draft.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc2.InsertMfDraft ( angle,
flipDir, isEdgeDraft, propType)

| Input: | (double) angle | Draft angle in radians |
| Input: | (BOOL) flipDir | Flip the direction of the draft; the draft direction is determined by the selected direction, which can be a planar face, a reference plane, an edge, or two vertices; if you refer to the last argument in ModelDoc2::SelectByMark and ModelDoc2::AndSelectByMark, these items would have a selection mark of 1; faces to be drafted have a selection mark of 2 and the draft edges have a selection mark of 4 |
| Input: | (BOOL) isEdgeDraft | Determines if it is an edge or neutral plane draft; TRUE if this is an edge draft and the user select edges to draft, FALSE if this is a face draft and the user  selects faces draft (the system automatically selects the faces next to the edge to be drafted) |
| Input: | (long) propType | Propagation type |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->InsertMfDraft
( angle, flipDir, isEdgeDraft, propType )

| Input: | (double) angle | Draft angle in radians |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) flipDir | Flip the direction of the draft; the draft direction is determined by the selected direction, which can be a planar face, a reference plane, an edge, or two vertices; if you refer to the last argument in ModelDoc2::SelectByMark and ModelDoc2::AndSelectByMark, these items would have a selection mark of 1; faces to be drafted have a selection mark of 2 and the draft edges have a selection mark of 4 |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) isEdgeDraft | Determines if it is an edge or neutral plane draft; TRUE if this is an edge draft and the user select edges to draft, FALSE if this is a face draft and the user  selects faces draft (the system automatically selects the faces next to the edge to be drafted) |
| Input: | (long) propType | Propagation type |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The propagation type argument propType can be one
of these values:

* 0 = no propagation.
* 1 = propagate
  to the next tangent faces that share the base neutral plane. You can specify
  this option for edge draft or neutral plane draft.
* 2 = propagate
  to all faces that are a neighbor of the neutral plane.
* 3 = propagate
  to all faces that are a neighbor of the neutral plane on all the inner
  loops (for example, all faces of a pocket or a boss).
* 4 = propagate
  to all faces that are a neighbor of the neutral plane on the outer loop
  (for example, the sides of a box with the bottom face as neutral plane).
