# ModelDoc2::CreateCircleByRadius2

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by SketchManager::CreateCircleByRadius.

Description

This method creates a circle based on a center
point and a specified radius.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc2.CreateCircleByRadius2 ( xc, yc,
zc, radius )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) xc | X value of the circle center point in meters |
| Input: | (double) yc | Y value of the circle center point in meters |
| Input: | (double) zc | Z value of the circle center point in meters |
| Input: | (double) radius | Radius of the circle in meters |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to the Dispatch object of the circle that was created |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->ICreateCircleByRadius2 ( xc,
yc, zc, radius, &retval )

| Input: | (double) xc | X value of the circle center point in meters |
| Input: | (double) yc | Y value of the circle center point in meters |
| Input: | (double) zc | Z value of the circle center point in meters |
| Input: | (double) radius | Radius of the circle in meters |
| Output: | (LPSKETCHSEGMENT) retval | Pointer to the circle that was created |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method creates a full circle in the active
2D sketch. If a sketch is not active, then a new sketch is created. You
can check for an active sketch using ModelDoc2::GetActiveSketch2.

For COM applications, the object pointer returned
from this function can be used to call any APIs on the SketchSegment interface.
The underlying SketchArc object can be obtained using QueryInterface on
the returned SketchSegment object.

OLE applications can define a new ISketchSegment
or ISketchArc object using the returned dispatch pointer. Visual Basic
applications interpret the pointer for you automatically, so you can use
the returned object to call SketchSegment or SketchArc functions.

ModelDoc2::SetAddToDB and ModelDoc2::SetDisplayWhenAdded
increase performance during entity creation by adding entities directly
to the SolidWorks database.

ModelDoc2::SetAddToDB also avoids some of the peculiarities
involved with creating entities via the user interface, such as inferencing,
automatic relations, and snapping to the grid. Adding entities directly
to the database also significantly increases the performance of this method.
When you are done creating entities, it is important to ModelDoc2::SetAddToDB(False),
to restore SolidWorks to its normal operating mode.

This method also works with ModelDoc2::SetDisplayWhenAdded.
If you have called ModelDoc2::SetAddToDB(True), additional performance
can be gained by calling ModelDoc2::SetDisplayWhenAdded(False) to disable
immediate display of entities as they are added to the database. When
you are done creating all of your sketch entities, you must redraw your
document window (see ModelDoc2::GraphicsRedraw2) to see the entities you
added. You should also restore the original display settings by calling
ModelDoc2::SetDisplayWhenAdded(True).

To create a circle using a center point and a point
on the circle, see ModelDoc2::CreateCircle2. To create a partial arc,
see ModelDoc2::CreateArc2.
