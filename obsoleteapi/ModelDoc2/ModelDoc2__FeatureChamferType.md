# ModelDoc2::FeatureChamferType

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by FeatureManager::InsertFeatureChamfer.

Description

This method creates a chamfer feature according to the type specified
(angle-distance, distance-distance, or vertex chamfer).

Syntax (OLE Automation)

(void) ModelDoc2.FeatureChamferType
( chamferType, width, angle, flip, otherDist, vertexChamDist1, vertexChamDist2,
vertexChamDist3 )

| Input: | (short) chamferType | Chamfer type as defined in swChamferType\_e |
| Input: | (double) width | Width for angle-distance chamfers or one distance for distance-distance chamfers |
| Input: | (double) angle | Angle for angle-distance chamfers |
| Input: | (BOOL) flip | TRUE to flip the direction of the chamfer, FALSE to not |
| Input: | (double) otherDist | Other distance for distance-distance chamfers |
| Input: | (double) vertexChamDist1 | First distance for vertex chamfers |
| Input: | (double) vertexChamDist2 | Second distance for vertex chamfers |
| Input: | (double) vertexChamDist3 | Last distance for vertex chamfers |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->FeatureChamferType
( chamferType, width, angle, flip, otherDist, vertexChamDist1, vertexChamDist2,
vertexChamDist3 )

Remarks

Both angle-distance and distance-distance chamfers are edge chamfers.
This means that all measurements are from edges. An angle-distance chamfer
requires an angle and a distance; a distance-distance chamfer requires
two distances for both sides of the chamfered edges.

A vertex chamfer only works on a vertex with three adjacent edges of
the same convexity. The distance values specified measure from the vertex
along three adjacent edges. For non-linear edges, this value is an arc
length value; it is not a chordal value.

See Vertex::EnumEdgesOriented to determine the edge order used by this
method.
