# ModelDoc2::GetMassProperties2

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by ModelDocExtension::GetMassProperties.

Description

This method returns the mass properties of
the current part or assembly.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc2.GetMassProperties2 ( &status
)

| Output: | (long) status | Status of the mass property results as defined in swMassPropertiesStatus\_e |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | a VARIANT of type SafeArray of doubles |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->IGetMassProperties2 ( &status,
&mPropsData )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (long) status | Status of the mass property results as defined in swMassPropertiesStatus\_e |
| Input: | (double) mPropsData | Pointer to an array of doubles |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The return value is a zero-based array of doubles
as follows:

[
CenterOfMassX, CenterOfMassY, CenterOfMassZ,
Volume, Area, Mass, MomXX, MomYY, MomZZ, MomXY, MomZX, MomYZ ]

Yu can obtain the density currently used by the
SolidWorks part by using SldWorks::GetUserPreferencDoubleValue. If the
density has not been explicitly set by the end-user, then a value of 1.0
is used. You can also derive the density of the body using the following
calculation:

    Density = ( Mass / Volume )

Consistent with all other API functions, units
returned are metric unless explicitly specified otherwise/
