# ModelDoc2::SketchSplineByEqnParams

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by SketchManager::CreateSplineByEqnParams.

Description

This method creates a spline on the active 2D sketch using the specified
b-curve parameters.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

Not available. See ModelDoc2::SketchSplineByEqnParams2.

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->ISketchSplineByEqnParams
( propArray, knotsArray, cntrlPntCoordArray, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (int\*)  propArray | Includes dimension, order, number of control points, and periodicity |
| Input: | (double\*) knotsArray | knot1, knot2, and so on |
| Input: | (double\*) cntrlPntCoordArray | controlpoint1[dimension], controlpoint2[dimension], and so on |
| Output: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if created successfully, FALSE if not |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The propArray argument contains 4 integers packed into the first two
doubles in the SafeArray:

* Dimension
* Order
* Number of Control Points
* Periodicity ( TRUE or FALSE )

The knotsArray argument is an array of doubles with (Number of Control
Points + Order) elements.

The size of the cntrlPntCoordArray array is based upon the curve dimension:

* Dimension = 2 then each control point is an array
  of 2 doubles ( x, y )
* Dimension = 3 then each control point is an array
  of 3 doubles ( x, y, z)
* Dimension = 4 then each control point is an array
  of 4 doubles ( x, y, z, w ) where w = weight

The parameters are provided as 3 arrays, which for COM applications
are passed separately.

Pass control point coordinates  to
this method in sketch space. The Z value is interpreted as 0. In certain
situations, you must transform your b-curve parameters to sketch space
with the help of Sketch::ModelToSketchTransform.

NOTE: If the spline being generated
is a closed spline, then it must be flagged as periodic. In addition,
splines generated in sketches must be G1 continuous. If the data passed
to this method does not generate a G1 continuous spline, then it is rejected
and a spline is not created.
