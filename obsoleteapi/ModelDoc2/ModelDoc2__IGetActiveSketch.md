# ModelDoc2::GetActiveSketch

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc2::](ModelDoc2__GetActiveSketch2.htm)GetActiveSketch2.

Description

This method returns the active sketch in document. If a sketch is not
currently active, or if the active sketch is a 3D sketch, then NULL is
returned.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc2.GetActiveSketch
()

| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to a Dispatch object, a sketch |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->IGetActiveSketch
( &retval )

| Output: | (LPSKETCH) retval | Pointer to the active Sketch object |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Before you can use this method, you must select
and activate a sketch. You can use ModelDoc2::SelectByID to select a sketch
and ModelDoc2::InsertSketch2 to make the sketch active.

To avoid regressions in existing applications,
this method returns NULL if the active sketch is a 3D sketch. To access
the active 2D or 3D sketch, use ModelDoc2::GetActiveSketch2. To determine
if a Sketch object is 2D or 3D, use Sketch::Is3D.

For an example of getting a sketch through Feature
traversal, see Get Sketches Example.
