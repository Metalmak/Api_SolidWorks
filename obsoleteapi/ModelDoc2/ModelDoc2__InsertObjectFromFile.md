# ModelDoc2::InsertObjectFromFile

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by ModelDocExtension::InsertObjectFromFile.

Description

This method adds an OLE object from a specified
file and inserts it at the location specified.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc2.InsertObjectFromFile ( filePath, createLink, x, y, z )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BSTR) filePath | Full path name to the file to insert |
| Input: | (BOOL) createLink | TRUE to create a link to the file, FALSE to embed the file |
| Input: | (double) x | X component of the location to insert the object |
| Input: | (double) y | Y component of the location to insert the object |
| Input: | (double) z | Z component of the location to insert the object |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if the operation was successful, FALSE otherwise |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->InsertObjectFromFile ( filePath,
createLink, x, y, z, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BSTR) filePath | Full path name to the file to insert |
| Input: | (BOOL) createLink | TRUE to create a link to the file, FALSE to embed the file |
| Input: | (double) x | X component of the location to insert the object |
| Input: | (double) y | Y component of the location to insert the object |
| Input: | (double) z | Z component of the location to insert the object |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | TRUE if the operation was successful, FALSE otherwise |

Remarks

Currently, only the drawing documents use the x,y,z
coordinate position. Part and assembly documents l place the inserted
object at the upper-right corner of the model view.
