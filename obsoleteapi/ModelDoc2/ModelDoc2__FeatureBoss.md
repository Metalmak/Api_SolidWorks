# ModelDoc2::FeatureBoss

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [ModelDoc2::FeatureBoss2](ModelDoc2__FeatureBoss2.htm).

Description

This method creates an extruded boss feature.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc2.FeatureBoss
( sd, flip, dir, t1, t2, d1, d2, dchk1, dchk2, ddir1, ddir2, dang1, dang2,
offsetReverse1, offsetReverse2)

| Input: | (BOOL) sd | TRUE for single-ended, FALSE for double-ended |
| Input: | (BOOL) flip | Not used |
| Input: | (BOOL) dir | TRUE if you want Direction 1 to be opposite the default direction |
| Input: | (long) t1 | Termination type for first end as defined in swEndConditions\_e |
| Input: | (long) t2 | Termination type for second end as defined in swEndConditions\_e |
| Input: | (double) d1 | Depth of extrusion for first end in meters |
| Input: | (double) d2 | Depth of extrusion for second end in meters |
| Input: | (BOOL) dchk1 | TRUE allows draft angle in first direction, FALSE does not allow drafting |
| Input: | (BOOL) dchk2 | TRUE allows draft angle in second direction, FALSE does not allow drafting |
| Input: | (BOOL) ddir1 | TRUE for first draft angle to be inward, FALSE for draft angle outward |
| Input: | (BOOL) ddir2 | TRUE for second draft angle to be inward, FALSE for draft angle outward |
| Input: | (double) dang1 | Draft angle for first end |
| Input: | (double) dang2 | Draft angle for second end |
| Input: | (BOOL) offsetReverse1 | TRUE specifies offset away from the sketch if you chose to offset the first end condition from another face or plane, FALSE specifies offset from the face or plane toward the sketch |
| Input: | (BOOL) offsetReverse2 | TRUE specifies offset away from the sketch if you chose to offset the second end condition from another face or plane, FALSE specifies offset from the face or plane toward the sketch |

Remarks

The default direction for cut operations is opposite the sketch normal.
The default direction for boss operations is along the sketch normal.
Setting the dir argument to TRUE reverses the default direction. For double-ended
extrusions, Direction 2 is always be opposite of Direction 1.

The default sketch normal is the same as the face or plane normal where
the sketch was placed. To determine this normal vector, see Face2::Normal
and RefPlane::GetRefPlaneParams, respectively.
