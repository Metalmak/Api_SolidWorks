# ModelDoc2::SaveAsSilent

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [ModelDoc2::SaveAs4](ModelDoc2__SaveAs4.htm).

Description

This method saves the current document with a new name. Dialog boxes
are suppressed.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

Errors =
ModelDoc2.SaveAsSilent ( newName, saveAsCopy)

| Input: | (BSTR) newName | New name of the document, which can be a name with suffix or a full path |
| Input: | (BOOL) saveAsCopy | TRUE to save the document to a new filename without replacing the name in the active session; documents that reference the document continue to reference the original file |
| Return: | (long) Errors | 0 for no error or a bitwise or of the errors encountered; see swFileSaveError\_e |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->SaveAsSilent
( newName, saveAsCopy, &Errors)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BSTR) newName | New name of the document, which can be a name with suffix or a full path |
| Input: | (BOOL) saveAsCopy | TRUE to save the document to a new filename without replacing the name in the active session; documents that reference the document will continue to reference the original file |
| Output: | (long) Errors | 0 for no error or a bitwise or of the errors encountered; see swFileSaveError\_e |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method is identical to ModelDoc2::SaveAs except
that dialog boxes are suppressed.

If the file was saved successfully then Errors
has a value of 0,; otherwise, it contains a bitwise
OR of the error codes that were generated in saving the document.
Check the masks against the values of the enumerator swFileSaveError\_e.

This method overwrites existing files on disk unless
they are read-only.
