# ModelDoc2::CreateCircleVB

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::CreateCircle2.

Description

This method creates a circle using a center point and another point
on the circle that helps determine the radius. This point also enables
any automatic relations, snapping to grid, and so on., which may be applicable
depending on its location. This method is for use in Visual Basic and
other forms of Basic that do not support SafeArrays.
