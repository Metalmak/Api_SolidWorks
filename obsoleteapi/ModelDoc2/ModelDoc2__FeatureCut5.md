Remarks

The default direction for cut operations is opposite
the sketch normal. The default direction for boss operations is along
the sketch normal. Setting the dir argument to TRUE reverses the default
direction. For double-ended extrusions, Direction2 is always opposite
to Direction1.

The default sketch normal is the same as the face
or plane normal where the sketch was placed. To determine this normal
vector, see Face2::Normal and RefPlane::Transform, respectively.

When there is ambiguity in the result of a cut,
the keepPieceIndex is used to resolve which of the possible results is
used. This can be set to -1 if there is no ambiguity; otherwise, it should
be the index of the result, starting from 0 (up to 1less than the possible
number of outcomes.)
