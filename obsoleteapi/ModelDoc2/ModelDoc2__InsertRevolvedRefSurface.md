# ModelDoc2::InsertRevolvedRefSurface

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by FeatureManager::InsertRevolvedRefSurface.

Description

This method creates a revolved
reference surface by revolving a profile around a centerline.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc2.InsertRevolvedRefSurface
( Angle, ReverseDir, Angle2, RevType )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) Angle | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (BOOL) ReverseDir | Angle is positive or negative ( TRUE or FALSE) |
| Input: | (double) Angle2 | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (int) RevType | Type of revolution |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->InsertRevolvedRefSurface
( Angle, ReverseDir, Angle2, RevType )

| Input: | (double) Angle | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) ReverseDir | Angle is positive or negative ( TRUE or FALSE) |
| Input: | (double) Angle2 | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (int) RevType | Type of revolution |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if euccessful |

Remarks

Make the selections using ModelDocExtension::SelectByID2
before calling this method. See the SolidWorks Help for information about
what entities are valid for selection.

The revType argument can be one of these values:

* 0 = One direction revolution.
* 1 = MidPlane revolution. For this type of
  revolve, the angle specification specifies the full revolution. The angle
  to revolve is (angle/2 ) on either side of the sketch. The reverseDir
  argument has no affect.
* 2 = Two direction revolution. For a two direction
  revolve, the angle is the angle to revolve in Direction1 and angle2 is
  the angle to revolve in Direction2.

This method does not support 3D sketches.
