# ModelDoc2::InsertCutBlend

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [ModelDoc2::InsertCutBlend2](ModelDoc2__InsertCutBlend2.htm).

Description

This method inserts a lofted cut based on the
selected profiles and guide curves. Selection of guide curves is optional;
however, selection of the profiles must be in an order consistent with
the desired direction of the loft.

#

Syntax (COM)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |

Remarks

Use of guide curves is recommended especially when
selection of profiles is done in the FeatureManager design tree.

You can use any number of profiles; however, if you have selected less
that three profiles, then any selected guide curves must be closed curves.

Use ModelDocExtension::SelectByID to select
the profiles and guide curves. The mark
for:

* profile selections should be a 1.
* any guide curve selection, if provided, should
  be a 2.
