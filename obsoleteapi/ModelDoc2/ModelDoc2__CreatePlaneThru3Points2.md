# ModelDoc2::CreatePlaneThru3Points2

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::CreatePlaneThru3Points3.

Description

This method creates a construction (also called reference) plane through
three currently selected points.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc2.CreatePlaneThru3Points2 ( )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to a Dispatch object, the newly created RefPlane object |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->ICreatePlaneThru3Points2 (
&retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (LPREFPLANE) retval | Pointer to the newly created RefPlane object |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful; S\_FALSE otherwise |

Remarks

This method uses the current document setting for
displaying of the reference plane as it is created. If display of reference
planes is disabled, then you do not see the reference plane on the screen
as it is created. If display of reference planes is enabled, then you
do see it as it is created. The ModelDoc2::GetUserPreferenceToggle and
ModelDoc2::SetUserPreferenceToggle APIs, with swDisplayPlanes enum value,
get or set this display preference.

This method does not select the reference plane
after it is created. Objects that are selected before running this method
are still selected when the method completes, not the newly created reference
plane.

This method returns a RefPlane object. This object
can then be used for further operations on the reference plane feature.
Just having a RefPlane may not be terribly useful, except that it is a
feature, which is an dntity, so methods available on those objects are
available. For an OLE user, those functions are directly accessible; for
a COM user, those functions are available via  QueryInterface.
For example, if the reference plane must be selected, use Entity::Select.
