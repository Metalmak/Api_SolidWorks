# ModelDoc2::SketchPolygon

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by SketchManager::CreatePolygon.

Description

This method creates a polygon in the active
sketch.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc2.SketchPolygon ( xCenter, yCenter, xEdge, yEdge, nSides, bInscribed )

| Input: | (double) xCenter | X component of the polygon's center |
| Input: | (double) yCenter | Y component of the polygon's center |
| Input: | (double) xEdge | X component of the first vertex on the polygon |
| Input: | (double) yEdge | Y component of the first vertex on the polygon |
| Input: | (int) nSides | Number of sides for the polygon |
| Input: | (BOOL) bInscribed | TRUE to show an inscribed construction circle, FALSE to show a circumscribed construction circle |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if polygon created, FALSE if not |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->SketchPolygon ( double xCenter,
double yCenter, double xEdge, double yEdge, int nSides, VARIANT\_BOOL\*
retval )

| Input: | (double) xCenter | X component of the polygon's center |
| Input: | (double) yCenter | Y component of the polygon's center |
| Input: | (double) xEdge | X component of the first vertex on the polygon |
| Input: | (double) yEdge | Y component of the first vertex on the polygon |
| Input: | (int) nSides | Number of sides for the polygon |
| Input: | (BOOL) bInscribed | TRUE to show an inscribed construction circle, FALSE to show a circumscribed construction circle. |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | TRUE if polygon created, FALSE if not |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

After using this method, the PropertyManager page
is in edit mode for the polygon. To exit this PropertyManager page and
complete the operation, use ModelDoc2::SetPickMode, ModelDoc2::ClearSelection2,
or exit the sketch.
