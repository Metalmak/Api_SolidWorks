# ModelDoc2::SaveAs4

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by ModelDocExtension::SaveAs.

Description

This method saves the document under a different
name.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc2.SaveAs4 ( Name, Version, Options,
&Errors, &Warnings )

#

| Input: | (BSTR) Name | New name of the document' the file extension indicates any conversion that should be performed (for example, Part1.igs to save to IGES) |
| Input: | (long) Version | Format in which to save this document as defined in swSaveAsVersion\_e |
| Input: | (long) Options | Option indicating how to save the document as defined in swSaveAsOptions\_e |
| Output: | (long) Errors | Errors that caused the save to fail as defined in swFileSaveError\_e |
| Output: | (long) Warnings | Warnings or extra information generated during the save operation as defined in swFileSaveWarning\_e |
| Output: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if the save is successful, FALSE if not |

#

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->SaveAs4 ( Name, Version, Options,
&Errors, &Warnings, &retval )

| Input: | (BSTR) Name | New name of the document; the file extension indicates any conversion that should be performed (for example, Part1.igs to save to IGES) |
| Input: | (long) Version | Format in which to save this document as defined in swSaveAsVersion\_e |
| Input: | (long) Options | Option indicating how to save the document as defined in swSaveAsOptions\_e |
| Output: | (long) Errors | Errors that caused the save to fail as defined in swFileSaveError\_e |
| Output: | (long) Warnings | Warnings or extra information generated during the save operation as defined in swFileSaveWarning\_e |
| Output: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if the save is successful, FALSE if not |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method:

* Overwrites
  existing files unless they are read-only.
* Results in
  FileSaveNotify being sent to any application listening.
* Removes any
  configuration-specific bitmap previews, except the current configuration's.

Saving a document as PDF when the document is open
as view-only is not supported.

Do not use ModelDoc2::SaveAs4 to copy assemblies,
drawings, or parts with in-context references. Instead, use SldWorks::CopyDocument.

The Name argument refers to the new name for the
saved document. The filename extension indicates any conversion that should
be performed (for example,  "Part1.igs"
to save to IGES). If the filename extension does not uniquely indicate
how the file should be saved, use the Version argument to determine how
to save the file. For example, to save:

* A standard
  drawing document as a detached drawing, specify swSaveAsDetachedDrawing
  for Version.
* A detached
  drawing as a standard drawing, specify swSaveAsStandardDrawing for Version.
* A standard
  or detached drawing document in the same format, specify swSaveAsCurrentVersion
  for Version.

You can specify additional Save
As options using SldWorks::SetUserPreferenceIntegerValue swUserPreferenceIntegerValue.
For example:

' Save assembly as multibody part and save exterior faces
as surface bodies

swApp.SetUserPreferenceIntegerValue swSaveAssemblyAsPartOptions,
\_

swSaveAsmAsPart\_ExteriorFaces

swModelDoc.SaveAs4 "H:\Assem1.SLDPRT", swSaveAsCurrentVersion,
\_

swSaveAsOptions\_Silent, nErrors, nWarnings

- or -

' Save all drawing sheets in active drawing
document as an eDrawings file

swApp.SetUserPreferenceIntegerValue swEdrawingsSaveAsSelectionOption,
swEdrawingSaveAll

swModelDoc.SaveAs4 "H:\Grid.edrw", swSaveAsCurrentVersion,
\_

swSaveAsOptions\_Silent, nErrors, nWarnings

If the file is saved successfully, then the retval
is TRUE and the Errors argument is 0. If the save is not successful, then
the retval is FALSE and the Errors argument contains a bitwise OR of the
error codes that were generated in saving the document. Check the masks
against the swFileSaveError\_e enumeration. If you do not want SolidWorks
to return error information, you can pass in NULL for the Errors argument.

Even if the file is saved successfully, there might
be warnings or information that occurs during the save in which you might
be interested. The Warnings argument contains a bitwise OR of the warning
codes that were generated when saving the document. Check the masks against
the swFileSaveWarning\_e enumeration. If you do not want warning information
returned, you can pass in NULL for the Warnings argument.

Use ModelDoc2::Save3 to save a file using
its current name.
