# ModelDoc2::SelectByMark

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [ModelDocExtension::SelectByID](../ModelDocExtension/ModelDocExtension__SelectByID.htm).

Description

This method and ModelDoc2::AndSelectByMark behave exactly the same as
the ModelDoc2::SelectById and ModelDoc2::AndSelectById, with the exception
that this method also marks the selected entity with the integer mark
provided as the last argument. This mark is used by certain API functions
that require multiple selections.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc2.SelectByMark ( selID,
selParams, x, y, z, mark)

| Input: | (BSTR) selID | ID of object; this case-sensitive string is intended for objects that are automatically named by SolidWorks during entity creation, such as  dimensions, drawing views, and so on; if you do not know the object ID or if it is an item that is not automatically named by SolidWorks, you can pass an empty string |
| Input: | (BSTR) selParams | Uppercase type name of object (for example, "EDGE") as defined by swSelectType\_e; if you do not know the object type, you can pass in an empty string |
| Input: | (double) x | X,Y,Z selection location; values are in meters; in certain situations you can simply pass in ( 0,0,0 ); see ModelDoc2::SelectByID for details |
| Input: | (double) y | See x argument |
| Input: | (double) z | See x argument |
| Input: | (long) mark | Number you want to use as a mark; this number is used by certain API functions that require ordered entity selection |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if item was successfully selected, FALSE otherwise |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->SelectByMark
( selID, selParams, x, y, z, mark, &retval )

| Input: | (BSTR) selID | ID of object; this case-sensitive string is intended for objects that are automatically named by SolidWorks during entity creation, such as: dimensions, drawing views, and so on; if you do not know the object ID or if it is an item that is not automatically named by SolidWorks, you can pass an empty string |
| Input: | (BSTR) selParams | Uppercase type name of object (for example, "EDGE") as defined by swSelectType\_e; if you do not know the object type, you can pass in an empty string |
| Input: | (double) x | X,Y,Z selection location; values are in meters; in certain situations you can simply pass in ( 0,0,0 ); see ModelDoc2::SelectByID for details |
| Input: | (double) y | See x argument |
| Input: | (double) z | See x argument |
| Input: | (long) mark | Number you want to use as a mark; this number is used by certain API functions that require ordered entity selection |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | TRUE if item was successfully selected, FALSE if not |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Use this method instead of using the individual
selection methods on the following objects:

* Annotation
* Component2
* Feature
* SketchHatch
* SketchPoint
* SketchSegment

The previously listed object's selection methods
do not work well when a PropertyManager page is open or a command is running.
This method, ModelDoc2::SelectByMark, handles selection correctly whether
or not a command is running.

If you specify a mark, SolidWorks puts the selection
into the selection list box that has that mark, regardless of whether
it is active or not. If you do not specify a mark, SolidWorks puts the
selection into the active selection list box. The selection still has
to pass the entity filtering criteria for that selection list box before
SolidWorks adds it completely.

If you want SolidWorks to mark your entity, pass
0 as the mark argument.
