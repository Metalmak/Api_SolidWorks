# ModelDoc2::SketchFillet2

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by SketchManager::CreateFillet.

Description

This method creates a sketch fillet between
the two sketch selected entities.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc2.SketchFillet2 ( radius, constrainedCorners )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) radius | Radius of the fillet in meters |
| Input: | (short) constrainedCorners | Action to take if the corner to be filleted is constrained or has a dimension  (see Remarks) |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if the fillet is created, FALSE if not |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->SketchFillet2 ( radius, constrainedCorners, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) radius | Radius of the fillet in meters |
| Input: | (short) constrainedCorners | Action to take if the corner to be filleted is constrained or has a dimension (see Remarks) |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | TRUE if the fillet s created, FALSE if not |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The constrainedCorners argument:

* Indicates
  what action to take if the corner to be filleted is constrained in some
  manner or has a dimension related to it. In this case, adding a fillet
  to the corner cannot be done without certain consequences. If the corner
  is not involved with any constraints, this argument is ignored.
* Can take
  one of the values found in swConstrainedCornerAction\_e.
