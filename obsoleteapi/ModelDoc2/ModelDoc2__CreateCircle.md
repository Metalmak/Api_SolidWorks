# ModelDoc2::CreateCircle

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc2::CreateCircle2](ModelDoc2__CreateCircle2.htm).

Description

This method creates a circle using a center point and another point
on the circle which helps determine the radius. This point also enables
any automatic relations/snapping to grid and so on that may be applicable
depending on its location. See ModelDoc2::CreateCircleVB for use in Visual
Basic and other forms of Basic that do not support SafeArrarys.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc2.CreateCircle ( p1x,
p1y, p1z, p2x, p2y, p2z)

|  |  |  |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->CreateCircle
( p1x, p1y, p1z, p2x, p2y, p2z, &retval )

| Input: | (double) p1x | Center point x value in meters |
