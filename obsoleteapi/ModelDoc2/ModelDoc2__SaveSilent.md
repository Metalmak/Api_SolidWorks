# ModelDoc2::SaveSilent

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc2::Save2](ModelDoc2__Save2.htm).

Description

This method saves the current document (with the current name). If it
is a new document, use ModelDoc2::SaveAsSilent instead. Dialog boxes are
suppressed.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

Errors= ModelDoc2.SaveSilent ( )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (long) Errors | 0 for no error or a bitwise OR of the errors defined by swFileSaveError\_e |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->SaveSilent (
&Errors)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (long) Errors | 0 for no error or a bitwise OR of the errors encountered defined by swFileSaveError\_e |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method is identical to ModelDoc2::Save except that dialog boxes
are suppressed.

If the file was saved successfully then Errors have the value 0; otherwise,
Errors contains a bitwise OR of the error codes that were generated in
saving the document. Check the masks against the values of the enumerator
swFileSaveError\_e.
