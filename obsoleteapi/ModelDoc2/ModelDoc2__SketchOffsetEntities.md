# ModelDoc2::SketchOffsetEntities

This
method is now obsolete and is now superseded by ModelDoc2::SketchOffsetEntities2.

Description

This method generates entities in the active sketch by offsetting the
selected geometry by the specified amount.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc2.SketchOffsetEntities
( offset, flip)

| Input: | (double) offset | Offset distance in meters |
| Input: | (BOOL) flip | TRUE if the offset direction should be flipped, FALSE otherwise |

Syntax
(COM)

status = ModelDoc2->SketchOffsetEntities
( offset, flip )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) offset | Offset distance in meters |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) flip | TRUE if the offset direction should be flipped, FALSE otherwise |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The geometry selected for offset can be an edge,
loop, face, external sketch curve, external sketch contour, set of edges,
or set of external sketch curves.

NOTE: If
the selected geometry is a sketch item, it must be an external sketch
curve (that is, it cannot be an item in the active sketch). To offset
sketch segments within the active sketch, use ModelDoc2::SketchOffset.
