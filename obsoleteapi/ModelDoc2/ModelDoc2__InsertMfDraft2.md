# ModelDoc2::InsertMfDraft2

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by FeatureManager::InsertMultifaceDraft.

Description

This method creates a multi-face draft.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc2.InsertMfDraft2 ( angle,
flipDir, isEdgeDraft, propType, stepDraft )

| Input: | (double) angle | Draft angle in radians |
| Input: | (BOOL) flipDir | Flip the direction of the draft; the draft direction is determined by the selected direction, which could be a planar face, a reference plane, an edge, or two vertices; if you refer to the mark argument in ModelDocExtension::SelectByID, these items would have a selection mark of 1; faces to draft a selection mark of 2, and draft edges a selection mark of 4 |
| Input: | (BOOL) isEdgeDraft | Determine if it is an edge or neutral plane draft; TRUE if this is an edge draft and the user selects edges to be drafted; FALSE if this is a face draft and the user selects faces to draft (the system automatically selects the faces next to the edge to be drafted) |
| Input: | (long) propType | Propagation type (see Remarks) |
| Input: | (BOOL) stepDraft | TRUE if the draft is a step draft, FALSE if not |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->InsertMfDraft2
( angle, flipDir, isEdgeDraft, propType, stepDraft )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) angle | Draft angle in radians |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) flipDir | Flip the direction of the draft; the draft direction is determined by the selected direction, which could be a planar face, a reference plane, an edge, or two vertices; if you refer to the mark argument in ModelDocExtension::SelectByID, these items would have a selection mark of 1; faces to draft a selection mark of 2, and draft edges a selection mark of 4 |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) isEdgeDraft | Determine if it is an edge or neutral plane draft; TRUE if this is an edge draft and the user selects edges to be drafted; FALSE if this is a face draft and the user selects faces to draft (the system automatically selects the faces next to the edge to be drafted) |
| Input: | (long) propType | Propagation type (see Remarks) |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) stepDraft | TRUE if the draft is a step draft, FALSE if not |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Make the selections using ModelDocExtension::SelectByID
before calling this method.

The propagation type argument propType can be one
of the following values:

* 0 = no propagation.
* 1 = propagate
  to the next tangent faces that share the base neutral plane. You can specify
  this option for an edge draft or neutral plane draft.
* 2 = propagate
  to all faces that are a neighbor of the neutral plane.
* 3 = propagate
  to all faces that are a neighbor of the neutral plane on all the inner
  loops (for example, all faces of a pocket or a boss).
* 4 = propagate
  to all faces that are a neighbor of the neutral plane on the outer loop
  (e.g. the sides of a box with the bottom face as neutral plane).

This method is the same as interactively creating
a draft by selecting Insert, Features,
Draft. See the SolidWorks Help for more information
about what entities are valid for selection.
