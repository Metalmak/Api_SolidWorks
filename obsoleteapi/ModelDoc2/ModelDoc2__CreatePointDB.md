# ModelDoc2::CreatePointDB

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by ModelDoc2::CreatePoint2.

IMPORTANT:  This
method ignores the z value when adding a point to a 3D sketch. Thus, update
your code to use the more current method, ModelDoc2::CreatePoint2.

Description

This method creates a point.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc2.CreatePointDB ( x, y, z )

#

|  |  |  |

| Input: | (double) z | z coordinate of the point |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | 1 = success, 0 = failure |

#

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->CreatePointDB ( x, y, z, &retval
)

|  |  |  |
