# ModelDoc2::FeatureBossThin

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [ModelDoc2::FeatureBossThin2](ModelDoc2__FeatureBossThin2.htm).

Description

This method creates a feature
by extruding a profile. A constant thickness is applied to the profile
during extrusion. The result is then added to the existing work piece.

| Input: | (double) thk1 | Wall thickness 1 (midplane type uses (thk1)/2 for each direction) |
| Input: | (double) thk2 | Wall thickness 2 (only used when thinType = 3) |

| Input: | (long) thinType | Thin feature type:   * 0   = one direction * 1   = one direction reverse * 2   = midplane * 3   = two direction |
| Input: | (long) capEnds | Cap the ends:   * 0   = no cap * 1   = cap (base features only) |

Remarks

The default direction for cut operations is opposite the sketch normal.
The default direction for boss operations is along the sketch normal.
Setting the dir argument to TRUE reverses the default direction. For double-ended
extrusions, Direction 2 is always be opposite of Direction 1.

The default sketch normal is the same as the face or plane normal where
the sketch was placed. To determine this normal vector, see Face2::Normal
and RefPlane::GetRefPlaneParams, respectively.
