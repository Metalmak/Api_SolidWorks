# ModelDoc2::SaveAs3

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [ModelDoc2::SaveAs4](ModelDoc2__SaveAs4.htm).

Description

This method saves the document under a different
name.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc2.SaveAs3 ( newName, saveAsVersion,
options )

#

| Input: | (BSTR) newName | New name of the document; the file extension indicates any conversion that should be performed; for example, Part1.igs to save to IGES |
| Input: | (long) saveAsVersion | Version as defined in swSaveAsVersion\_e |
| Input: | (long) options | Option as defined in swSaveAsOptions\_e |
| Output: | (long) retval | 0 if no errors during save; otherwise, errors occurred |

#

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc2->SaveAs3 ( newName, saveAsVersion,
options, &retval )

| Input: | (BSTR) newName | New name of the document; the file extension indicates any conversion that should be performed; for example, Part1.igs to save to IGES |
| Input: | (long) saveAsVersion | Version as defined in swSaveAsVersion\_e |
| Input: | (long) options | Option as defined in swSaveAsOptions\_e |
| Output: | (long) retval | 0 if no errors during save; otherwise, errors occurred |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

#

Remarks

The options argument is a bitmask containing various
BOOLEANS that affect the outcome of saving the document.

If the file was saved without errors, retval has a value of 0. Otherwise, it contains
a bitwise OR of the error codes that were generated when saving the document.
However, not all of the File,  Save
return codes are fatal errors. It is a bitmask of different conditions
that can occur during the operation; some of which are fatal, some are
informational or warnings. Check the masks in swFileSaveError\_e.

This method:

* Overwrites
  existing files on disk unless they are read-only.
* Results in
  FileSaveAsNotify being sent to any application listening.

To save the referenced part files when using this
method on an assembly document, you must specify these enumerators for
the Options argument:

* swSaveAsOptions\_Silent
* swSaveAsOptions\_Copy
* swSaveAsOptions\_SaveReferenced
