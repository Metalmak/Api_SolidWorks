# ModelDoc2::FeatureRevolveCut2

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by FeatureManager::FeatureRevolveCut.

Description

This method creates a revolved feature cut.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc2.FeatureRevolveCut2
( angle, reverseDir, angle2, revType, Options)

| Input: | (double) angle | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (BOOL) reverseDir | TRUE if angle is positive, FALSE if negative |
| Input: | (double) angle2 | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (long) revType | Type of revolution:   * 1 = MidPlane revolution. For this type of revolve,   the angle argument specifies the full revolution. The angle to revolve   is (angle/2) on either side of the sketch. The reverseDir argument has   no effect. * 2 = Two-direction revolution. For a two direction   revolve, the angle argument is the angle to revolve in Direction1 and   the angle2 argument is the angle to revolve in Direction2. |
| Input: | (long) Options | Additional control as defined in swAutoCloseSketch; close the sketch if it is open |
| Return: | (long) retval | 0 if no error, 1 if error |

Syntax (COM)

angle, reverseDir, angle2, revType, Options, &retval )
