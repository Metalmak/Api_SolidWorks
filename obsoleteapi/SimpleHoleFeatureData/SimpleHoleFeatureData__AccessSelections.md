# SimpleHoleFeatureData::AccessSelections

This
method is obsolete and superseded by SimpleHoleFeatureData2::AccessSelections.

Description

This method gains access to the selections
used to define the simple hole feature.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

accessGained = SimpleHoleFeatureData.AccessSelections
( topDoc, component )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (LPDISPATCH) topDoc | Top-level document |
| Input: | (LPDISPATCH) component | Component in which the feature is to modify |
| Return: | (BOOL) accessGained | TRUE if the selections are successfully accessed |

Syntax (COM)

status = SimpleHoleFeatureData ->IAccessSelections
( topDoc, component, &accessGained )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (LPMODELDOC) topDoc | Top-evel document |
| Input: | (LPCOMPONENT) component | Component in which the feature is to modify |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) accessGained | TRUE if the Selections are successfully accessed |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

To modify a feature in a part, the TopDoc argument
is the ModelDoc for the part and the Component argument should be NULL.

To modify a feature in an assembly, the TopDoc
argument should be the assembly's ModelDoc object and the Component argument
should be the Component object in which the feature is to be modified.

This method puts the model into a rollback state
to allow access to the selections that define the simple hole feature.
You must use SimpleHoleFeatureData::ReleaseSelectionAccess to restore
the rollback state unless you call Feature::ModifyDefinition.
