This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by SimpleHoleFeatureData2::ReleaseSelectionAccess.

Description

This method releases access to the selections
used to define the simple hole feature.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void SimpleHoleFeatureData.ReleaseSelectionAccess
( )

Syntax (COM)

| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

SimpleHoleFeatureData::AccessSelections puts the
model into a rollback state to allow access to the selections that define
the simple hole Feature. You must use SimpleHoleFeatureData::ReleaseSelectionAccess
to restore the rollback state unless you call Feature::ModifyDefinition.
