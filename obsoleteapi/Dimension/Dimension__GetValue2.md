# Dimension::GetValue2

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by Dimension::GetValue3.

Description

This method gets the value of the current dimension
in the named configuration.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Dimension.GetValue2 ( configName )

| Input: | (BSTR) configName | Name of the configuration |
| Return: | (double) retval | Value of the dimension in user units |

Syntax (COM)

status = Dimension->GetValue2 ( configName, &retval
)

| Input: | (BSTR) configName | Name of the configuration |
| Output: | (double) retval | Value of the dimension in user units |

if there is more than one configuration.

This method returns a value
in user units, which it gets from the document in which the dimension
was created.
