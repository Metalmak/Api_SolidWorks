# Dimension::SetToleranceValues

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by DimensionTolerance::SetValues.

Description

This
method sets the tolerance minimum and maximum values.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= Dimension.SetToleranceValues ( tolMin, tolMax )

| Input: | (double) tolMin | Minimum tolerance value |
| Input: | (double) tolMax | Maximum tolerance value |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if the values were set successfully, FALSE if they were not |

Syntax (COM)

status
= Dimension->SetToleranceValues ( tolMin, tolMax, &retval )

| Input: | (double) tolMin | Minimum tolerance value |
| Input: | (double) tolMax | Maximum tolerance value |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | TRUE if the values were set successfully, FALSE if they were not |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

For symmetric tolerances, this method uses the tolMax value.

You cannot set the tolerance values if the tolerance type is swTolNONE.
