# Component::GetSectionedBodies

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by Component2::GetSectionedBodies.

Description

This method gets the sectioned bodies seen in the specified view and
returns them as a SafeArray of Dispatch pointers to each individual Body
object.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= Component.GetSectionedBodies ( viewIn)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (LPDISPATCH) viewIn | Dispatch pointer to the model view object displaying the sectioned view |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray of Dispatch pointers to the sectioned bodies in the specified view |

Syntax (COM)

status
= Component->GetSectionedBodies ( viewIn, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (LPDISPATCH) viewIn | Dispatch pointer to the model view object displaying the sectioned view |
| Output: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray of Dispatch pointers to the sectioned bodies in the specified view |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

To determine if the desired model view
is currently displaying a sectioned view, use ModelView::GetDisplayState.

If you need the full body representation,
use Component::GetBody or PartDoc::Body, which ignore the sectioning operation.

For COM implementations, refer to Component::EnumSectionedBodies.

If a component is suppressed or lightweight, this method might return
NULL because the component is loaded into memory. For more information
on lightweight components, refer to Working With Lightweight Components.
