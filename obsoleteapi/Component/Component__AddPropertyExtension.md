# Component::AddPropertyExtension

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by Component2::AddPropertyExtension.

Description

This method allows you to store a float, string, or integer value on
this Component object. You must first define the VARIANT type (float,
string, or integer), give your variable a value, and then call this method
to place the value on the component for future reference.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= Component.AddPropertyExtension ( PropertyExtension)

| Input: | (VARIANT) PropertyExtension | Value you want to store on the component |
| Return: | (long) retval | Unique identifier returned to allow access to the property extension in the future; SolidWorks returns -1 if it cannot set the property |

Syntax (COM)

status = Component->AddPropertyExtension
( PropertyExtension, &retval )

| Input: | (VARIANT) PropertyExtension | Value you want to store on the component |
| Output: | (long) retval | Unique identifier returned to allow access to the property extension in the future; SolidWorks returns -1 if it cannot set the property |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Use the Attribute, AttributeDef, and Parameter classes instead of this
method. These classes are provide more flexibility.
