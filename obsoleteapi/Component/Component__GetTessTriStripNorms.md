# Component::GetTessTriStripNorms

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by Component2::GetTessTriStripNorms.

Description

This method gets the normal vector for each
of the triangles, which make up the shaded picture tessellation for this
component.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Component.GetTessTriStripNorms ( )

| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray containing the tri-strip normals |

Syntax (COM)

status = Component->IGetTessTriStripNorms ( retval
)

| Output: | (float\*) retval | Pointer to an array of floats (see Remarks) |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Tessellation information is
available only when the component is loaded as lightweight.

The format of the returned data is:

* DWORD FaceCount
* DWORD StripCount
* DWORD (VertexCount)
  x 3
* DWORD NumStrips
* DWORD [VertexPerStrip]
  where this is an array from 0 to (Numstrips-1)
* Float
  [Normals ]
  where this is an array of X,Y,Z normal components for each strip from
  0 to (VertexPerStrip-1)

where

* FaceCount  = number of faces on
  the body
* StripCount  = total number of
  strips on the body
* VertexCount x 3  = total number
  of vertices; multiplied by three to cover X,Y, and Z
* NumStrips = number of strips on
  a particular face
* VertexPerStrip = an array containing
  the number of vertex points on particular face strip
* NormalComp = an array of X,Y,Z
  normal components for each vertex on the particular face strip
