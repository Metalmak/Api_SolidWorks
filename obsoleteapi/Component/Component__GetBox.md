# Component::GetBox

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by Component2::GetBox.

Description

This method gets the bounding box for this component object.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= Component.GetBox ( includeRefPlanes, includeSketches)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BOOL) includeRefPlanes | TRUE if you want the bounding box returned to include reference planes, FALSE if not |
| Input: | (BOOL) includeSketches | TRUE if you want the bounding box returned to include sketches, FALSE if not |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT containing the two diagonal points that bound the component; the format of the VARIANT is a SafeArray of 6 doubles |

Syntax (COM)

status
= Component->IGetBox ( includeRefPlanes, includeSketches, retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL)includeRefPlanes | TRUE if you want the bounding box returned to include reference planes, FALSE if not |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL)includeSketches | TRUE if you want the bounding box returned to include sketches, FALSE if not |
| Output: | (double\*) retval | Two diagonal points that bound the component in the form of a pointer to an array of 6 doubles |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The X, Y, Z points that this method returns are the lower- and upper-diagonal
corners that bound the component with the box sides parallel to the X,
Y, and Z axes. These box dimensions enclose the component and are typically,
but not always, close to the minimum possible size.

The return value is an array of doubles as follows:

[
XCorner1, YCorner1, ZCorner1, XCorner2,
YCorner2, ZCorner2 ]

It is possible for this method to return S\_FALSE for COM applications
or a NULL VARIANT for Dispatch applications. This occurs if your application
calls Component::GetBox with a component that represents a subassembly
and that subassembly is not loaded in SolidWorks. After the subassembly
is loaded, the correct bounds are returned and Component::IGetBox returns
S\_OK.

The user interface behavior is the same. When the user selects a subassembly
that has not been loaded, there is no selection box around the subassembly.
However, after the subassembly loads, there is a selection box.
