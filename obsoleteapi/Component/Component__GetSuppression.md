# Component::GetSuppression

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by Component2::GetSuppression.

Description

This method provides access to the suppression state of this component.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

Suppression= Component.GetSuppression

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (long) Suppression | Suppression state of this component instance as defined in swComponentSuppressionState\_e |

Syntax (COM)

status = Component->GetSuppression(
&Suppression )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (long) Suppression | Suppression state of this component instance as defined in swComponentSuppressionState\_e |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Use this method to determine if the component is suppressed, lightweight,
or fully resolved. Knowing the suppression state of the component is critical
because lightweight and suppressed components contain only a small subset
of data compared with a fully resolved component. For more information,
see Working With Lightweight Components.
