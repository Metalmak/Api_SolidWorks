# Component::Name

This
property is obsolete and has been superseded by [Component::Name2](Component__Name2.htm).

Description

This property gets the component name.

Syntax
(OLE Automation)

Name
= Component.Name (VB Get property)

Name
= Component.GetName ( ) (C++ Get property)

| Property: | (BSTR) Name | Name of this component instance |

Syntax
(COM)

status = Component->get\_Name( &Name
)

| Property: | (BSTR) Name | Name of this component instance |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This name of the component appears in the FeatureManager design tree
and is not necessarily the same as the name of the underlying part or
assembly file.

This property returns a name that includes an instance number. For example:

Part1-1

indicates that this is the first instance of the Part1 Component2. If
you are examining a component that is within a subassembly, then this
property returns a name that includes the full hierarchical path of component
names. For example:

subAssem1-2/Part1-1

indicates that this component (Part1) is the first instance within the
subAssem1 Component2. It also shows that this is the second instance of
subAssem1 .

As a side note, there is a User Option,
External Reference setting that
allows or prohibits changes to this name. This setting affects only interactive
user operations.

If you are setting the name of a component,
remember that some special characters
are reserved by SolidWorks.
