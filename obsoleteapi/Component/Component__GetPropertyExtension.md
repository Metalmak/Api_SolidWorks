|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) Id | Unique identifier of the property extension |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | Value that was stored using Component::AddPropertyExtension |

Syntax (COM)

The VARIANT type returned by this method is based on the how the data
was placed on the component. See Component::AddPropertyExtension.

Use Attribute, AttributeDef, and Parameter instead of this method. These
classes are newer and provide more flexibility.
