# Component::IsSuppressed

This method is obsolete and has been superseded by Component2::IsSuppressed.

Description

This method determines if this component is suppressed. The suppression
state of this component may vary based on the active configuration.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= Component.IsSuppressed ()

| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if this component is suppressed, FALSE if it was not |

Syntax (COM)

status
= Component->IsSuppressed ( &retval )

| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | TRUE if this component is suppressed, FALSE if it was not |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

You might want to use [Component::GetSuppression](Component__GetSuppression.htm),
which returns the specific suppression state of the component.

NOTE: For
lightweight components, Component::IsSuppressed returns TRUE.
