# Component::GetTessNorms

This method is obsolete and has been superseded by
Component2::GetTessNorms.

Description

This method returns the normal vector for each
of the triangles, which make up the shaded picture tessellation for the
component.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Component.GetTessNorms (
)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray |

Syntax (COM)

status = Component->IGetTessNorms ( retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (float\*) retval | Pointer to an array of floats |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Tessellation information is available only when the component is loaded
as lightweight.

The format of the returned data is:

* float
  x, y, z first point's unit normal
* float
  x, y, z second point's unit normal
* float
  x, y, z third point's unit normal

for the set of triangles for the component.

The total size of the data is [ 9 x sizeof(float)
x (number of triangles) ].
