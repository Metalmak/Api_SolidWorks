# Component::GetTessTriangles

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by Component2::GetTessTriangles.

Description

This method returns the triangles that make
up the shaded picture tessellation for this component.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Component.GetTessTriangles ( noConversion )

| Input: | (BOOL) noConversion | TRUE prohibits conversion to user units from system units, FALSE does not |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray (see Remarks) |

Syntax (COM)

status = Component->IGetTessTriangles ( noConversion,
retval )

| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) noConversion | TRUE prohibits conversion to user units from system units, FALSE does not |
| Output: | (float\*) retval | Pointer to array of floats (see Remarks) |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Tessellation information is
available only when the component is loaded as lightweight.

These triangles are intended for graphical display purposes and do not
represent a tessellation that an be used, for example, by a machining
application. If you need the type of accuracy associated with a machining
product, we recommend that you traverse the body faces and extract the
topology and geometry data to create your own faceting.

The format of the returned data is:

* float x, y, z first
  point in meters
* float x, y, z second
  point in meters
* float x, y, z third
  point in meters

for the set of triangles for the component.

The total size of the data is [ 9 x sizeof(float)
x (number of triangles) ].
