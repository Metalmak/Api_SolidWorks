# Component::GetPathName

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by Component2::GetPathName.

Description

This method gets the full path name of this component.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= Component.GetPathName ( )

| Return: | (BSTR)retval | Full path name for this component, including the file name |

Syntax (COM)

status
= Component->GetPathName ( &retval )

| Output: | (BSTR)retval | Full path name for this component, including the file name |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if Successful |

Remarks

It is possible that the underlying document for this component is not
loaded into memory. This can happen if the component is lightweight or
suppressed. When this happens, [Component::GetModelDoc](Component__GetModelDoc.htm)
returns NULL, and this method returns the as-saved file and path name
for the component. Component::GetPathName does not apply search criteria
or look in the current working directory for the component file reference
if the component is lightweight or suppressed.
