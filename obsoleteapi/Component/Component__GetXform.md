# Component::GetXform

This method is obsolete and has been superseded by
[Component2::GetXform](../Component2/Component2__GetXform.htm).

Description

This method gets the transform of this Component object. The transform
is returned in relation of the root component (see Configuration::GetRootComponent).

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval
= Component.GetXform ()

| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT containing a SafeArray of 16 doubles |

Syntax (COM)

status
= Component->IGetXform ( retval )

| Output: | (double\*) retval | Pointer to an array of 16 doubles |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

If this configuration is exploded, then this method returns an exploded
transform.

This method returns the transform as an array of 16 elements. The first
9 are elements of a standard 3x3 rotation matrix, the next 3 define translation,
the next 1 is scaling. The last 3 elements are unused.

The transform is returned in relation to
the root component.
