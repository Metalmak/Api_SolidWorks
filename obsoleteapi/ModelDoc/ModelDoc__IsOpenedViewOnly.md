Remarks

SolidWorks loads files using multi-threading. When a file is being loaded,
the graphics are displayed immediately and the user is able to perform
certain zoom and pan functions. If the view is shaded, you also have the
option to rotate the view. Until all data and references have been loaded,
the file is in view-only mode. Also, a file can be in view-only mode if
the user has chosen to load the file for viewing purposes. A user can
do this by selecting File, Open
and toggling the view-only button to on. Your application should check
for view-only mode to determine how to proceed.

When a file is in view-only mode, many API queries will return NULL
or empty data.
