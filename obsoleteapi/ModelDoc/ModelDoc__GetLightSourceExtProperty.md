# ModelDoc::GetLightSourceExtProperty

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::GetLightSourceExtProperty.

Description

This method retrieves a float, string, or integer value stored for the
light source. The VARIANT type returned is based on the how the data was
placed. See ModelDoc::AddLightSourceExtProperty for reference.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.GetLightSourceExtProperty
( Id, PropertyId)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) Id | ID of the light source |
| Input: | (long) PropertyId | ID of the property extension |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | Value stored for the light source |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->GetLightSourceExtProperty
( Id, PropertyId, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) Id | ID of the light source |
| Input: | (long) PropertyId | ID of the property extension |
| Output: | (VARIANT) retval | Value stored for the light source |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The light source ID ranges from 0 to n,
where n = (the total number of
light sources - 1). To get the total number of light sources, use ModelDoc::GetLightSourceCount.
