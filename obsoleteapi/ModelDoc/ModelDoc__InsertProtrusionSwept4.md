# ModelDoc::InsertProtrusionSwept4

This method is obsolete
and has been superseded by [ModelDoc2::InsertProtrusionSwept4](../ModelDoc2/ModelDoc2__InsertProtrusionSwept4.htm).

Description

This method inserts a swept boss or base feature from the selected profile
and the selected sweep curves.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc.InsertProtrusionSwept4 ( propagate,
alignment, twistCtrlOption, keepTangency, forceNonRational, startMatchingType,
endMatchingType, isThinBody, thickness1, thickness2, thinType)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BOOL) propagate | If TRUE, then the loft will propagate to the next tangent edge, FALSE and it will not propagate |
| Input: | (BOOL) alignment | If the curve used to sweep goes from one face to another, or from one edge to another, passing TRUE will cause the sweep to cut completely through the end faces of the cut; if you choose FALSE, then the swept cut will begin and end perpendicular to the sweep curve and, therefore, may not break through the two end faces of the body being cut |
| Input: | (short) twistCtrlOption | Twist control options |
| Input: | (BOOL) keepTangency | If the section curves are tangent, then you have the option to specify whether the resulting faces will also be tangent; specify TRUE to maintain the tangency as seen in the section curves, FALSE otherwise; when generating tangent faces, SolidWorks will maintain planar and cylindrical face shapes if the section curves exhibit these characteristics |
| Input: | (BOOL) forceNonRational | TRUE to force the resulting surface to be non-rational, FALSE otherwise |
| Input: | (short) startMatchingType | Tangency type |
| Input: | (short) endMatchingType | Tangency type |
| Input: | (BOOL) isThinBody | TRUE if this feature is a thin body, FALSE otherwise |
| Input: | (double) thickness1 | Thickness value for the first direction |
| Input: | (double) thickness2 | Thickness value for the second direction |
| Input: | (short) thinType | TRUE if this feature is a thin feature, FALSE otherwise |

| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Use SelectByMark and AndSelectByMark to select the profile and sweep
curves. The mark for the profile selection should be a 1; the mark for
the sweep path should be 4. If guide curve selection is provided, then
SelectByMark mark should be 2.

The twistCtrlOption argument may take one of the following values:

* 0 = Follow path
* 1 = Keep constant normal
* 2 = Follow path and
  first guide curve
* 3 = Follow first and
  second guide curve

The tangency
type arguments may take the following values:

* 0
  - none
* 1
  - tangent to the normal of the profile
* 2
  - tangent to a selected vector
* 3
  - tangency to all the adjacent faces sharing an edge with the start profile
* 4
  - tangent to some of the selected faces sharing an edge with the start
  profile (not avaliable at this moment)
