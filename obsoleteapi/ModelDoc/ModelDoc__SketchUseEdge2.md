# ModelDoc::SketchUseEdge2

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc2::SketchUseEdge2](../ModelDoc2/ModelDoc2__SketchUseEdge2.htm).

Description

This method uses the selected edges to generate geometry in the active
sketch.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.SketchUseEdge2 ( chain )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BOOL) chain | TRUE if you want entire chain of entities offset, FALSE if you want only selected sketch entities offset |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if the offset was successful |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->SketchUseEdge2 ( chain, &retval
)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) chain | TRUE if you want entire chain of entities offset, FALSE if you want only selected sketch entities offset |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | TRUE if the offset was successful |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

See also ModelDoc::SketchOffsetEntities.

Specifying TRUE to the chain Mode argument will
offset the selected entity and any other entities that belong to the same
contour or chain (Contiguous geometric entities like edges.).
