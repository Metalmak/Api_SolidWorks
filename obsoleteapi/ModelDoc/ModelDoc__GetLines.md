# ModelDoc::GetLines

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::GetLines.

Description

This method gets all of the lines in the current sketch.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.GetLines ()

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->IGetLines ( retval
)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (double\*) retval | Pointer to an array doubles |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The return value is the following array of doubles:

[ LineType,
StartPtX, StartPtY, StartPtZ, EndPtX, EndPtY, EndPtZ, ...
]

where this array of 7 values repeats
itself for each line in the current sketch. The number of doubles returned
will be (number of lines \* 7).
To determine the number of lines in the current sketch, use [ModelDoc::GetLineCount](ModelDoc__GetLineCount.htm).

See swLineTypes\_e for valid line types.
