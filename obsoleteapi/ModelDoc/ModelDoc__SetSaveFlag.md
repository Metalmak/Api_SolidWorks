# ModelDoc::SetSaveFlag

This method is obsolete
and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::SetSaveFlag.

Description

This method flags the document as dirty. If the user tries to close
the part, SolidWorks pops up the Do you
wish to save changes dialog.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc.SetSaveFlag ()

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->SetSaveFlag (
)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

If your application data has changed, this method allows you to mark
the SolidWorks document as dirty so that the user is prompted if he or
she tries to close it. This could be used, for example, with applications
that use the IGet3rdPartyStorage mechanism to save stream data in SolidWorks
files.

This method is not needed when you have programmatically changed the
SolidWorks model because doing so automatically flags the document as
dirty.
