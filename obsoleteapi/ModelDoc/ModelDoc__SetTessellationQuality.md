# ModelDoc::SetTessellationQuality

This method is obsolete
and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::SetTessellationQuality.

Description

This method sets the tessellation quality index for the application.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc.SetTessellationQuality
( qualityNum)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) qualityNum | Number between 0 and 100, which indicates the quality of tessellation to use for this part; a higher index means finer tessellation |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->SetTessellationQuality
( qualityNum )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) qualityNum | Number between 0 and 100, which indicates the quality of tessellation to use for this part; a higher index means finer tessellation |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method changes the shaded-display quality setting that you find
on the Tools, Option, Performance
menu.

The numeric deviation value will change based on the current part. This
deviation is calculated as follows:

Deviation = 0.025 \* (BodyDiameter) / qualityIndex;

where BodyDiameter is the diagonal distance across the bounds of the
part box . See PartDoc::GetPartBox.

The resulting Deviation value is in meters.

NOTE:
This method sets the quality in the overall environment, not just the
current part.
