# ModelDoc::AddSceneExtProperty

This
property is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::AddSceneExtProperty.

Description

This method stores a float, string, or integer value for a scene. This
scene extension property is stored on the model document, but is unique
to the model's scene. To add the extension property, you must first define
the VARIANT type (float, string, or integer), give your variable a value,
and then call this method to place the value on the light source for future
reference.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.AddSceneExtProperty
( PropertyExtension)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT) PropertyExtension | Value you wish to store for the scene |
| Return: | (long) retval | Unique identifier returned to allow you to access the Property Extension in the future |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->AddSceneExtProperty
( PropertyExtension, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT) PropertyExtension | Value you wish to store for the scene |
| Output: | (long) retval | Unique identifier returned to allow you to access the Property Extension in the future |
