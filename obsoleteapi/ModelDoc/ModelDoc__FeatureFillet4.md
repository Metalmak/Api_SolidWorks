# ModelDoc::FeatureFillet4

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc2::FeatureFillet4](../ModelDoc2/ModelDoc2__FeatureFillet4.htm).

Description

This method creates an edge fillet feature.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.FeatureFillet4 ( r1, propagate, uniformRadius, ftype, varRadTyp, overFlowType,
nRadii, radii, useHelpPoint, useTangentHoldLine, cornerType, setbackDistCount,
setBackDistances )

| Input: | (double) r1 | Fillet radius |
| Input: | (BOOL) propagate | TRUE uses tangent propagation, FALSE does not |
| Input: | (BOOL) uniformRadius | TRUE uses a uniform radius, FALSE does not |
| Input: | (int) ftype | 0 for simple, 1 for variable radius, 2 for surface blend |
| Input: | (BOOL) varRadTyp | 0 for linear, 1 for smooth transition (variable radius) |
| Input: | (long) overFlowType | Control of fillet overflowing onto adjacent surfaces |
| Input: | (int) nRadii | Number of radii for a multiple-radius fillet |
| Input: | (VARIANT) radii | Array if radii for multiple-radius fillet of size nRadii |
| Input: | (BOOL) useHelpPoint | TRUE uses help points, FALSE does not |
| Input: | (BOOL) useTangentHoldLine | TRUE uses a tangent hold line, FALSE does not |
| Input: | (BOOL) cornerType | TRUE uses round corners, FALSE does not |
| Input: | (int) setbackDistCount | Number of setback distances when the fillet of type setback |
| Input: | (VARIANT) setBackDistances | Array of size setbackDistCount |
| Return: | (long) retval | Fillet ID |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->IFeatureFillet4 ( r1, propagate,
uniformRadius, ftype, varRadTyp, overFlowType, nRadii, radii, useHelpPoint,
useTangentHoldLine, cornerType, setbackDistCount, setBackDistances, &retval
)

| Input: | (double) r1 | Fillet radius |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) propagate | TRUE uses tangent propagation, FALSE does not |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) uniformRadius | TRUE uses a uniform radius, FALSE does not |
| Input: | (int) ftype | 0 for simple, 1 for variable radius, 2 for surface blend |

| Input: | (long) overFlowType | Control of fillet overflowing onto adjacent surfaces |
| Input: | (int) nRadii | Number of radii for a multiple-radius fillet |
| Input: | (double\*) radii | Array if radii for multiple-radius fillet of size nRadii |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) useHelpPoint | TRUE uses help points, FALSE does not |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) useTangentHoldLine | TRUE uses a tangent hold line, FALSE does not |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) cornerType | TRUE uses round corners, FALSE does not |
| Input: | (int) setbackDistCount | Number of setback distances when the fillet of type setback |
| Input: | (double\*) setBackDistances | Array of size setbackDistCount |
| Output: | (long) retval | Fillet ID |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful; S\_FALSE otherwise |

Remarks

The overFlowType controls how the fillet behaves
when it meets adjacent surfaces:

* 0 - Default
  - the system will pick the appropriate method to create a fillet when
  the fillet surface overflows to adjacent surfaces. It will either smoothly
  blend with adjacent surfaces or limit the fillet surface with the adjacent
  edges (thus not changing the edge) or trim the fillet surface by the adjacent
  surface the fillet overflow onto. The method which is actually used by
  default will depend on the geometric condition. This option will always
  try to create a fillet if possible.
* 1 - Keep
  Edge - the edges that are overflowed by the fillet will not be modified.
  The fillet surface will be trimmed by all the adjacent edges. As a result,
  an additional transition fillet surface might be needed to complete the
  fillet.
* 2 - Keep
  Surface - the fillet surface will either be merged with the adjacent surfaces
  smoothly or trimmed by the adjacent surfaces. As a result, it is unlikely
  that an additional transition fillet surface will be created.

For face blend fillets, mark the first faces to
select with the value 2, and then mark the second set of faces to select
with a value of 4.
