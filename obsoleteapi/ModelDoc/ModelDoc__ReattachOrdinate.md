Remarks

To use this method, you must first select the dimension
to be reattached and then call ModelDoc::AndSelecteByID to select the
new entity to which to attach this dimension. For example:

Part.SelectByID "D6@Sketch2@Part1.SLDDRW", "DIMENSION",
0.0194564, 0.0695452, 0

Part.AndSelectByID "", "EDGE", 0.0310388,
0.05887719999651, -499.8885
