)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (int) modeIn | Pop-up menu mode |

Remarks

When a user clicks the right-mouse button (RMB)
on an entity in the graphics window, they are presented with one of two
distinct menu sets. These menu sets have been defined as mode 0 and mode
1:

### Mode

0 – Default RMB
mode. This presents the user with options to Select
Other, manipulate the view, access the properties dialog of the
selected item, and so on

1 – The user is
presented with a limited set of choices including Select
Other and Clear Selection.
This mode is seen typically when a SolidWorks dialog is active and the
user is restricted to entity selection.

Using this method, you can simulate the same RMB
menu behavior. If you have a dialog that requires user selection of entities,
you can set the pop-up menu mode to 1 to simulate SolidWorks behavior.
Your application should always set the menu mode back to its previous
value. The previous value can be determined by calling ModelDoc::GetPopupMenuMode
prior to your call to ModelDoc::SetPopupMenuMode.
