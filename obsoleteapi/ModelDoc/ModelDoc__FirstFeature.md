Remarks

For access to the next feature in the FeatureManager design tree and
access to subfeatures, see  Feature::GetNextFeature
and Feature::GetFirstSubFeature, respectively.

If a feature is suppressed, this method still accesses the feature.

Your application should not assume that the name or the order of SolidWorks
features is always the same. For example, you should not assume that the
first feature in the list is always be a reference plane. Additionally,
because feature names are customizable, you cannot assume that the first
reference plane feature is named Plane1. See Feature::GetTypeName and
Feature::Name for details.
