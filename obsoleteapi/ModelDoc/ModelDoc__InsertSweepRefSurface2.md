# ModelDoc::InsertSweepRefSurface2

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::InsertSweepRefSurface2.

Description

This method creates a reference surface by sweeping the selected profile
along the selected sweep curves. Because you are creating a surface, the
sections can be open.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

(void) ModelDoc.InsertSweepRefSurface2
( propagate, twistCtrlOption, keepTangency, forceNonRational, startMatchingType,
endMatchingType )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (Boolean) propagate | If TRUE, then the sweep will propagate to the next edge,  FALSE will cause the sweep to occur only on the selected edge  NOTE: To propagate to the next edge, the next edge must be tangent to the current edge. |
| Input: | (short) twistCtrlOption | Twist control options |
| Input: | (Boolean) keepTangency | Follow path |
| Input: | (Boolean) forceNonRational | Keep constant normal |
| Input: | (short) startMatchingType | Tangency type |
| Input: | (short) endMatchingType | Tangency type |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->InsertSweepRefSurface2
( propagate, twistCtrlOption, keepTangency, forceNonRational, startMatchingType,
endMatchingType )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) propagate | If TRUE, then the sweep will propagate to the next edge,  FALSE will cause the sweep to occur only on the selected edge  NOTE: To propagate to the next edge, the next edge must be tangent to the current edge. |
| Input: | (short) twistCtrlOption | Twist control options |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) keepTangency | Follow path |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) forceNonRational | Keep constant normal |
| Input: | (short) startMatchingType | Tangency type |
| Input: | (short) endMatchingType | Tangency type |
|  |  |  |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Use SelectByMark and AndSelectByMark to select the profile and sweep
curves. The mark for the profile selection should be a 1, the mark for
the sweep path should be 4. If guide curve selection is provided, the
SelectByMark mark should be 2.

The twistCtrlOption may take one of the following values:

* 0 = Follow path
* 1 = Keep constant normal
* 2 = Follow path and
  first guide curve
* 3 = Follow first and
  second guide curve

The tangency
type arguments may take the following values:

* 0
  - none
* 1
  - tangent to the normal of the profile
* 2
  - tangent to a selected vector
* 3
  - tangency to all the adjacent faces sharing an edge with the start profile
* 4
  - tangent to some of the selected faces sharing an edge with the start
  profile (not available at this moment)
