# ModelDoc::InsertRadiateSurface

This method is obsolete
and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::InsertRadiateSurface.

Description

This method creates a radiate surface based on the selections.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc.InsertRadiateSurface(
distance, flipDir, tangentPropagate )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) distance | Distance to extend the surface |
| Input: | (BOOL) flipDir | TRUE to flip the direction; by default the direction is out from the center of the face |
| Input: | (BOOL) tangentPropagate | TRUE to propagate the surface along tangent faces, FALSE limits the surface to the selected face. |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->InsertRadiateSurface(
distance, flipDir, tangentPropagate )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) distance | Distance to extend the surface |
| Input: | (BOOL) flipDir | TRUE to flip the direction; by default the direction is out from the center of the face |
| Input: | (BOOL) tangentPropagate | TRUE to propagate the surface along tangent faces, FALSE limits the surface to the selected face. |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method is the same as interactively creating a Radiate Surface
by selecting Insert,
Reference Geometry, Radiate Surface.
See SolidWorks Help for more information about what entities are
valid for selection.

To use this method, make the selections using SelectByMark
with mark of 2.
