# ModelDoc::CreateEllipse2

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc2::CreateEllipse2](../ModelDoc2/ModelDoc2__CreateEllipse2.htm).

Description

This method creates an ellipse, given a center
point and points that specify the major and minor axis.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.CreateEllipse2 ( centerX, centerY,
centerZ, majorX, majorY, majorZ, minorX, minorY, minorZ )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) centerX | X value for the ellipse center point |
| Input: | (double) centerY | Y value for the ellipse center point |
| Input: | (double) centerZ | Z value for the ellipse center point |
| Input: | (double) majorX | X value for a point on the ellipse and on the major axis |
| Input: | (double) majorY | Y value for a point on the ellipse and on the major axis |
| Input: | (double) majorZ | Z value for a point on the ellipse and on the major axis |
| Input: | (double) minorX | X value for a point on the ellipse and on the minor axis |
| Input: | (double) minorY | Y value for a point on the ellipse and on the minor axis |
| Input: | (double) minorZ | Z value for a point on the ellipse and on the minor axis |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to the Dispatch object of the ellipse that was created |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->ICreateEllipse2
( centerX, centerY, centerZ, majorX, majorY, majorZ, minorX, minorY, minorZ,
&retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) centerX | X value for the ellipse center point |
| Input: | (double) centerY | Y value for the ellipse center point |
| Input: | (double) centerZ | Z value for the ellipse center point |
| Input: | (double) majorX | X value for a point on the ellipse and on the major axis |
| Input: | (double) majorY | Y value for a point on the ellipse and on the major axis |
| Input: | (double) majorZ | Z value for a point on the ellipse and on the major axis |
| Input: | (double) minorX | X value for a point on the ellipse and on the minor axis |
| Input: | (double) minorY | Y value for a point on the ellipse and on the minor axis |
| Input: | (double) minorZ | Z value for a point on the ellipse and on the minor axis |
| Output: | (LPSKETCHSEGMENT) retval | Pointer to the ellipse that was created |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method creates an ellipse in the active 2D
sketch. If a sketch is not active, then a new sketch is created. You can
check for an active sketch using ModelDoc::GetActiveSketch2.

For COM applications, the object pointer returned
from this method can be used to call any APIs on the SketchSegment interface.
The underlying SketchEllipse object can be obtained using QueryInterface
on the returned SketchSegment object.

OLE applications can define a new SketchSegment
or SketchEllipse object using the returned dispatch pointer. Visual Basic
applications will interpret the pointer for you automatically, so you
can use the returned object to call SketchSegment or SketchEllipse functions.

ModelDoc::SetAddToDB and ModelDoc::SetDisplayWhenAdded
increase performance during entity creation by adding entities directly
to the SolidWorks database.

ModelDoc::SetAddToDB will also allow you to avoid
some of the peculiarities involved with creating entities via the user
interface, such as inferencing, automatic relations, and snapping to the
grid. Adding entities directly to the database also significantly increase
the performance of this API. When you are done creating entities, it is
important to call  ModelDoc::SetAddToDB(False)
to restore SolidWorks to its normal operating mode.

This API also works with ModelDoc::SetDisplayWhenAdded.
If you have called ModelDoc::SetAddToDB(True), additional performance
can be gained by calling ModelDoc::SetDisplayWhenAdded(False) to disable
immediate display of entities as they are added to the database. When
you are done creating all of your sketch entities, you must redraw your
document window (see ModelDoc::GraphicsRedraw2) to see the entities you
have added. You should also restore the original display settings by calling
ModelDoc::SetDisplayWhenAdded(True).
