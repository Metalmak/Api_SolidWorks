# ModelDoc::SetAddToDB

This method is obsolete
and has been superseded by [ModelDoc2::SetAddToDB](../ModelDoc2/ModelDoc2__SetAddToDB.htm).

Description

This method sets whether sketch entities are added directly to the SolidWorks
database.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc.SetAddToDB ( setting)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BOOL) setting | TRUE if you want items added directly to the SolidWorks database, FALSE otherwise |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->SetAddToDB (
setting )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) setting | TRUE if you want items added directly to the SolidWorks database, FALSE otherwise |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

One of the benefits of adding sketch entities directly to the database
is that you can avoid grid and entity snapping. For example, if you create
a sketch line whose endpoint is near another entity or near a grid point,
the new line endpoint will snap to the other item or grid point. Using
SetAddToDB( True ) will avoid this behavior during sketch entity creation.

The [SetAddToDB](ModelDoc__SetAddToDB.htm) and [SetDisplayWhenAdded](ModelDoc__SetDisplayWhenAdded.htm)
functions will also will increase performance during sketch entity creation.
[SetDisplayWhenAdded](ModelDoc__SetDisplayWhenAdded.htm) requires
that SetAddToDB is TRUE.

If you want to constrain all the sketch entities after creation, you
can use the Sketch::ConstrainAll function.
