# ModelDoc::FeatureReferenceCurve

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::FeatureReferenceCurve.

Description

This method create
a reference curve feature from an array of curves.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.FeatureReferenceCurve
( numOfCurves, baseCurves, merge, fromFileName, &errorCode )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) numOfCurves | Number of curves from which to create the object |
| Input: | (VARIANT) baseCurves | SafeArray of Dispatch pointers to the curves |
| Input: | (BOOL) merge | TRUE creates a single reference curve feature, FALSE creates a reference curve feature for each curve in the array |
| Input: | (BSTR) fromFileName | Not used |
| Output: | (long) errorCode | Error code as defined in swFeatureError\_e |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Dispatch pointer to ReferenceCurve Object. |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->IFeatureReferenceCurve
( numOfCurves, baseCurves, merge, fromFileName, &errorCode, &retval
)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long)numOfCurves | Number of curves from which to create the object |
| Input: | (LPCURVE)\*baseCurves | Pointer to an array of curves |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) merge | TRUE creates a single reference curve feature, FALSE creates a reference curve feature for each curve in the array |
| Input: | (BSTR) fromFileName | Not used |
| Output: | (long) errorCode | Error code as defined in swFeatureError\_e |
| Output: | (LPREFERENCECURVE) retval | Pointer to ReferenceCurve object |
