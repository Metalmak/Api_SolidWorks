# ModelDoc::GetFirstAnnotation2

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::GetFirstAnnotation2.

Description

This method gets the first annotation in the
model.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.GetFirstAnnotation2(
)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Dispatch object for the first Annotation object in the model |

Syntax (COM)

status
= ModelDoc->IGetFirstAnnotation2( &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (LPANNOTATION) retval | Pointer to the first Annotation object in the model |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

For part and assembly documents, this method returns the first Annotation
object in the model. For drawing documents, access annotations using View::GetFirstAnnotation2.

The difference between ModelDoc::GetFirstAnnotation and ModelDoc::GetFirstAnnotation2 is that ModelDoc::GetFirstAnnotation2 retrieves any display dimension, including
suppressed, hidden, or dangling dimensions.

A dimension becomes suppressed or hidden when you specifically select
a dimension and hide it, or when you select a feature and say hide all
dimensions. So if you need to filter out these dimensions, you will have
to use the Annotation::Visible API
to check that status.

If the annotation is on a layer that isn't shown, the annotation will
still be returned.

If annotations are not displayed, or any specific types of annotations
are not displayed due to user Annotation Properties settings, the [ModelDoc::GetUserPreferenceToggle](ModelDoc__GetUserPreferenceToggle.htm)
API can be used to discover those situations.
