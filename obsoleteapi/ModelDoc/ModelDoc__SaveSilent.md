# ModelDoc::SaveSilent

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc::Save2](ModelDoc__Save2.htm).

Description

This method saves the current document with the current name. If it
is a new document, use ModelDoc::SaveAsSilent instead. Dialog boxes are
suppressed.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

Errors= ModelDoc.SaveSilent ( )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (long) Errors | 0 for no error or a bitwise OR of the errors encountered; see swFileSaveError\_e |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->SaveSilent (
&Errors)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (long) Errors | 0 for no error or a bitwise OR of the errors encountered; see swFileSaveError\_e |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method is identical to ModelDoc::Save except that dialog boxes
are suppressed.

If the file was saved successfully, then Errors will have the value
0; otherwise, it will contain a bitwise OR of the error codes that were
generated in saving the document. The masks to check against are the values
of the enumerator swFileSaveError\_e.
