# ModelDoc::AddDimension2

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::AddDimension2.

Description

This method creates a dimension for the current selected entities at
the specified location.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.AddDimension2 ( x, y, z )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) x | Dimension text location, in meters |
| Input: | (double) y | Dimension text location, in meters |
| Input: | (double) z | Dimension text location, in meters |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | A pointer to the newly created dimension |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->IAddDimension2 ( x, y, z, &retval
)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) x | Dimension text location, in meters |
| Input: | (double) y | Dimension text location, in meters |
| Input: | (double) z | Dimension text location, in meters |
| Output: | (LPDISPLAYDIMENSION) retval | A pointer to the newly created dimension |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Be aware that dimensions are created based on selection location. For
example, creating an angular dimension between two lines will get different
results based on which line endpoints are selected. Therefore, if you
are using ModelDoc2::SelectByID to select the entities for dimensioning,
you should specify the XYZ selection coordinates.

You must also leave the objectName argument empty, because if you pass
the objectName argument to ModelDoc2::SelectByID, then the selection routines
will try to locate that item without
using the coordinates. Because coordinates are ignored when an
objectName is passed, the dimensioning routines will not be able to use
a specific selection location for the dimension. This will cause unpredictable
results in your dimension creation because you cannot be sure which line
endpoint is selected by the ModelDoc2::SelectByID routine.
