Remarks

File custom property information is stored in the
document file. It may be general to the file, in which case there is a
single value whatever the models configuration, or it may be configuration
specific, in which case a different value may be set for each configuration
in the model.

To access a general custom property information
value the configuration argument should be set to be an empty string.
