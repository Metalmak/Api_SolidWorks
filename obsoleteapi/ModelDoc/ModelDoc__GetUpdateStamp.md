# ModelDoc::GetUpdateStamp

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::GetUpdateStamp.

Description

This method returns the current update stamp for
this document.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.GetUpdateStamp ()

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (long) retval | Current update stamp value for this document |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->GetUpdateStamp
( &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (long) retval | Current update stamp value for this document |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The update stamp is essentially an integer form
of a time stamp. The update stamp is incremented for model state changes
(for example,  suppressing
or unsuppressing features in a model, configuration changes, feature changes,
and so on) and for geometric changes (for example, anything that requires
a rebuild). This time stamp is not incremented for operations such as
color changes, feature or configuration name changes, and so on.
