Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.FeatureRevolve2 (
angle, reverseDir, angle2, revType, Options)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) angle | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (BOOL) reverseDir | Angle is positive or negative ( TRUE or FALSE) |
| Input: | (double) angle2 | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (long) revType | Type of revolution |
| Input: | (long) Options | Additional control |
| Return: | (long) retval | 0 for no error |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->FeatureRevolve2(
angle, reverseDir, angle2, revType, Options, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) angle | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) reverseDir | Angle is positive or negative ( TRUE or FALSE) |
| Input: | (double) angle2 | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (long) revType | Type of revolution |
| Input: | (long) Options | Additional control |
| Output: | (long) retval | 0 for no error |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |
