# ModelDoc::FeatureBossThin

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc2::FeatureBossThin](../ModelDoc2/ModelDoc2__FeatureBossThin.htm).

Description

This method creates a feature by extruding
a profile. A constant thickness is applied to the to profile during the
extrusion. The result is then added to the existing work piece.

Remarks

Termination type can be any of the values as defined in swEndConditions\_e.

The default direction for cut operations are opposite the sketch normal.
The default direction for boss operations is along the sketch normal.
Setting ddir1 and ddir2 arguments to TRUE reverses the default direction.
For double-ended extrusions, Direction2  is
always opposite to Direction1.

The default sketch normal is the same as the face or plane normal where
the sketch was placed. To determine this normal vector, use Face2::Normal
and RefPlane::GetRefPlaneParams, respectively.
