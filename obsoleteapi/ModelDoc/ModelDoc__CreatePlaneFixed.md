# ModelDoc::CreatePlaneFixed

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc2::CreatePlaneFixed](../ModelDoc2/ModelDoc2__ICreatePlaneFixed.htm).

Description

This method creates a fixed reference plane through three points. The
resulting plane is not parametric.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.CreatePlaneFixed
( P1, P2, P3, useGlobal)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT) P1 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x1, y1, z1) in meters; this is the first of three model-space points used to define the plane orientation; it can also be used as the origin for the plane coordinate system |
| Input: | (VARIANT) P2 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x2, y2, z2) in meters; this is the second of three model-space points used to define the plane orientation; it can also be used to determine the direction of the plane's X-axis; the plane's X-axis will be directed from P1 to P2 unless useGlobal is set to TRUE |
| Input: | (VARIANT) P3 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x3, y3, z3) in meters; this is the final model-space point used to define the plane orientation |
| Input: | (BOOL) useGlobal | Flag controlling X-axis orientation |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if plane is created successfully, FALSE if not |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->ICreatePlaneFixed
( P1, P2, P3, useGlobal )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double\*) P1 | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x1, y1, z1) in meters; this is the first of three model-space points used to define the plane orientation; it can also be used as the origin for the plane coordinate system |
| Input: | (double\*) P2 | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x2, y2, z2) in meters; this is the second of three model-space points used to define the plane orientation; it can also be used to determine the direction of the plane's X-axis; the plane's X-axis will be directed from P1 to P2 unless useGlobal is set to TRUE |
| Input: | (double\*) P3 | Pointer to an array of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x3, y3, z3) in meters; this is the final model-space point used to define the plane orientation |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) useGlobal | Flag controlling X-axis orientation |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The planes normal vector is calculated using the cross product of the
vectors (P2 - P1) and (P3 - P1), respectively.

The X-axis of the planes coordinate system is a vector from P1 to P2,
or it is a vector that was projected from the X-axis of the global coordinate
system onto the plane.

The useGlobal argument denotes whether to align the X-axis
of the plane with global orientation. If set to TRUE, then the X-axis
of the global (model) coordinate system is projected onto the plane. That
vector is used to determine the direction of the plane's X-axis. This
does not reorient the plane. Instead, it rotates the plane coordinate
system about P1 until the X-axis of the plane aligns with the projected
vector. P1, P2, and P3 are still required because they define the plane.
If FALSE, then the X-axis of the plane is  aligned
based on your input points: P1 and P2.
