# ModelDoc::SketchSplineByEqnParams2

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc2::SketchSplineByEqnParams2](../ModelDoc2/ModelDoc2__SketchSplineByEqnParams2.htm).

Description

This method creates a spline on the active 2D sketch using the Bcurve
parameters provided. The intention of this method is to provide easier
access for Visual Basic applications than ModelDoc::SketchSplineByEqnParams.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.SketchSplineByEqnParams2
( paramsIn )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT) paramsIn | VARIANT of type SafeArray containing an array of doubles |
| Return: | (Boolean) retval | TRUE if created successfully |

Syntax (COM)

See ModelDoc::SketchSplineByEqnParams.

Remarks

The propArray argument contains 4 integers (placed in the first four
doubles in the SafeArray):

* Dimension
* Order
* Number of control points
* Periodicity ( TRUE or FALSE )

The knotsArray argument is an array of doubles with (Number of control
points + order) elements.

The size of the cntrlPntCoordArray array
is based upon the curve dimension.

* Dimension
  = 2 then each Control Point is an array of 2 doubles ( x, y )
* Dimension
  = 3 then each Control Point is an array of 3 doubles ( x, y, z)
* Dimension
  = 4 then each Control Point is an array of 4 doubles ( x, y, z, w ) where
  w = weight

The parameters are provided as 3 arrays, which for OLE automation are
packed into a single SafeArray, which is packed as follows:

[ Dimension,
Order, Number of control Points, Periodicity, knot1, knot2,...,ControlPoint1[Dimension],
ControlPoint2[Dimension],... ]

Control point coordinates should be passed to this routine in sketch
space. The Z value is interpretted as 0. In certain situations, you must
transform your Bcurve parameters to sketch space with the help of Sketch::ModelToSketchXform.

NOTE: If the spline being generated
is a closed spline, then it must be flagged as periodic. In addition,
splines generated in sketches must be G1 continuous. If the data passed
to this method does not generate a G1 continuous spline, then it is rejected
and no spline is created. If your data is not G1 continuous, then you
must split the spline into multiple G1 segments and call this method for
each segment.
