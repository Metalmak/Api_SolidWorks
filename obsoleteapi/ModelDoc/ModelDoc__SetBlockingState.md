# ModelDoc::SetBlockingState

This method is obsolete
and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::SetBlockingState.

Description

This method sets the blocking state for the SolidWorks menus.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

(void) ModelDoc.SetBlockingState (
stateIn )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) stateIn | One of the swBlockingStates\_e options |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->SetBlockingState
( stateIn )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) stateIn | One of the swBlockingStates\_e options |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Reset the state when operations are completed by calling ModelDoc::ResetBlockingState.

NOTE:
There must be a corresponding call to ModelDoc::ResetBlockingState for
every call to ModelDoc::SetBlocking. It is not enough to call ModelDoc::ResetBlockingState
once at the end of a sequence of operations that have called ModelDoc::SetBlockingState
several times.
