This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::CreateCenterLine.

Description

This method creates a center line from P1 to P2. Use ModelDoc::CreateCenterLineVBin
Visual Basic and other forms of Basic that do not support SafeArrays.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.CreateCenterLine
( P1, P2)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT) P1 | VARIANT of type SafeArrayof 3 doubles(x1, y1, z1) in meters that describe the first point of the line |
| Input: | (VARIANT) P2 | VARIANT of type SafeArrayof 3 doubles(x2, y2, z2) in meters that describe the second point of the line |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if success, FALSE if fail |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->ICreateCenterLine
( P1, P2 )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double\*) P1 | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z) in meters that describe the line start point |
| Input: | (double\*) P2 | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x,y,z) in meters that describe the line start point |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

You can also create centerline construction geometry
using ModelDoc::CreateLine2 and SketchSegment::ConstructionGeometry.
