# ModelDoc::CreatePlanePerCurveAndPassPoint2

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc2::CreatePlanePerCurveAndPassPoint2](../ModelDoc2/ModelDoc2__CreatePlanePerCurveAndPassPoint2.htm).

Description

This method creates a reference plane that is perpendicular to the selected
curve and passes through a selected point.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.CreatePlanePerCurveAndPassPoint2
( origAtCurve )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BOOL) origAtCurve | TRUE if you want the origin to be on the curve, FALSE otherwise |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to a Dispatch object, the newly created RefPlane object |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->ICreatePlanePerCurveAndPassPoint2
( origAtCurve, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) origAtCurve | TRUE if you want the origin to be on the curve, FALSE otherwise |
| Output: | (LPREFPLANE) retval | Pointer to the newly created RefPlane object |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful; S\_FALSE otherwise |

Remarks

This method follows the current document setting
for displaying of the reference plane as it is created. If display of
reference planes is disabled, then you do not see the reference plane
on the screen as it is created. If display of reference planes is enabled,
then you see it as it is created. ModelDoc2::GetUserPreferenceToggle and
ModelDoc2::SetUserPreferenceToggle with swDisplayPlanes enum value get
or set this display preference.

This method does not select the reference plane
after it is created. Objects that are selected before running this method
are still selected when the method completes rather than the newly created
reference plane.

This method returns a RefPlane object. This object
can then be used for operations on the reference plane feature. Just having
a RefPlane object may not be terribly useful, except that it is a feature,
which is an entity, so methods available on those objects are available.
For an OLE user, those functions are directly accessible; for a COM user,
those functions are available via use of a QueryInterface. For example,
if the reference plane must be selected, use Entity::Select.
