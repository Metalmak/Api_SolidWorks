# ModelDoc::IsActive

This method is obsolete
and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::IsActive.

Description

This method determines if the specified assembly component is displayed;
this is, the show and hide functionality associated with assembly components.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.IsActive ( compStr)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BSTR) compStr | Name specification of the component |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if model is shown, FALSE if model is hidden |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->IsActive ( compStr,
&retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BSTR) compStr | Name specification of the component |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | TRUE if model is shown, FALSE if model is hidden |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The compStr parameter is the
full assembly component name designation. The format of the name designation
is:

parentModel/childModel

where the child model is the model you wish to determine the display
status. For example, if you want to determine the display status of a
part named SPOKE.SLDPRT and if this part was a child of WHEEL.SLDPRT,
which itself is a child of AXIS.SLDPRT, then you would specify compStr
as follows:

AXIS/WHEEL/SPOKE

TIP: The assembly component
name designation is shown in the lower-eft hand corner of the SolidWorks
application when an assembly component is selected.
