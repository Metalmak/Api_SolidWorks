# ModelDoc::InsertSweepRefSurface

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc::InsertSweepRefSurface2](ModelDoc__InsertSweepRefSurface2.htm).

Description

This method creates a reference surface by sweeping the selected profile
along the selected sweep curves. Because you are creating a surface, the
sections can be open.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc.InsertSweepRefSurface
( propagate, twistCtrlOption, keepTangency, forceNonRational)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BOOL) propagate | If TRUE, then the sweep will propagate to the next edge, FALSE will cause the sweep to occur only on the selected edge  NOTE: To propagate to the next edge, the next edge must be tangent to the current edge. |
| Input: | (short) twistCtrlOption | Twist control options |
| Input: | (BOOL) keepTangency | Follow path |
| Input: | (BOOL) forceNonRational | Keep constant normal |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->InsertSweepRefSurface
( propagate, twistCtrlOption, keepTangency, forceNonRational )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) propagate | If TRUE, then the sweep will propagate to the next edge, FALSE will cause the sweep to occur only on the selected edge  NOTE: To propagate to the next edge, the next edge must be tangent to the current edge. |
| Input: | (short) twistCtrlOption | Twist control options |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) keepTangency | Follow path |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) forceNonRational | Keep constant normal |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Use SelectByMark and AndSelectByMark to select the profile and sweep
curves. The mark for the profile
selection should be a 1; mark for the sweep path should be 4.
If guide curve selection is provided, then  SelectByMark
mark should be 2.

The twistCtrlOption
may take one of the following values:

* 0
  = Follow path
* 1
  = Keep constant normal
* 2
  = Follow path and first guide curve
* 3
  = Follow first and second guide curve
