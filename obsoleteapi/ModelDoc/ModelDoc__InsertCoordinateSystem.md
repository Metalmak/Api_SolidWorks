# ModelDoc::InsertCoordinateSystem

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::InsertCoordinateSystem.

Description

This method inserts a coordinate system based
on selections.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc.InsertCoordinateSystem
( xFlipped, yFlipped, zFlipped )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BOOL) xFlipped | TRUE to flip the x direction |
| Input: | (BOOL) yFlipped | TRUE to flip the y direction |
| Input: | (BOOL) zFlipped | TRUE to flip the z direction |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->InsertCoordinateSystem
( xFlipped, yFlipped, zFlipped )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) xFlipped | TRUE to flip the x direction |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) yFlipped | TRUE to flip the y direction |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) zFlipped | TRUE to flip the z direction |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful. |

Remarks

Programmatic selections should be made with a SelectByMark method. Use
the following marks with your SelectByMark selections:

* 1 Origin
* 2 X Axis
* 4 Y Axis
* 8 Z Axis

This method does not require all three axis to be selected. The behavior
is the same as interactively creating a coordinate system by selecting
Insert, Reference
Geometry, Coordinate System.
