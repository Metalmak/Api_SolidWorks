# ModelDoc::SaveBMP

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::SaveBMP.

Description

This method saves the current view as bitmap
file.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.SaveBMP ( filenameIn,
widthIn, heightIn )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BSTR) filenameIn | Complete filename and path of the new bitmap file |
| Input: | (long) widthIn | Width of the bitmap |
| Input: | (long) heightIn | Height of the bitmap |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if file was created successfully |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->SaveBMP (filenameIn, widthIn,
heightIn, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BSTR) filenameIn | Complete filename and Path of the new bitmap file |
| Input: | (long) widthIn | Width of the bitmap |
| Input: | (long) heightIn | Height of the bitmap |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | TRUE if file was created successfully |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

The filenameIn argument should include the full
path to the file to be created. The extension should be .bmp.

If the widthIn or the heightIn argument is less
than or equal to 0, the view size is based on the current window size.
