# ModelDoc::CreateLinearSketchStepAndRepeat

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::CreateLinearSketchStepAndRepeat.

Description

This method creates linear sketch step-and-repeat.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.CreateLinearSketchStepAndRepeat
( num1, num2, spacing1, spacing2, angle1, angle2, deleteInstances )

| Input: | (long) num1 | Total number of instances along Direction1, including the seed |
| Input: | (long) num2 | Total number of instances along Direction2, including the seed |
| Input: | (double) spacing1 | Spacing between elements along Direction1 |
| Input: | (double) spacing2 | Spacing between elements along Direction2 |
| Input: | (double) angle1 | Relative to the X axis, the angle for Direction1 |
| Input: | (double) angle2 | Relative to the X axis, the angle for Direction2 |
| Input: | (BSTR) deleteInstances | Instance numbers to delete passed as a string in the format: "(a) (b) (c) " |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if the sketch pattern was created successfully, FALSE otherwise |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->CreateLinearSketchStepAndRepeat
(num1, num2, spacing1, spacing2, angle1, angle2, deleteInstances, &retval
)

| Input: | (long) num1 | Total number of instances along Direction1, including the seed |
| Input: | (long) num2 | Total number of instances along Direction2, including the seed |
| Input: | (double) spacing1 | Spacing between elements along Direction1 |
| Input: | (double) spacing2 | Spacing between elements along Direction2 |
| Input: | (double) angle1 | Relative to the X axis, the angle for Direction1 |
| Input: | (double) angle2 | Relative to the X axis, the angle for Direction2 |
| Input: | (BSTR) deleteInstances | Instance numbers to delete passed as a string in the format: "(a) (b) (c) " |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | TRUE if the sketch pattern was created successfully, FALSE otherwise |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful; S\_FALSE otherwise |
