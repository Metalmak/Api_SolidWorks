# ModelDoc::CreateLine

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc::CreateLine2](ModelDoc__CreateLine2.htm).

Description

This method creates a line from P1 to P2.  It
also enables automatic relations for the line,  which
may not be suitable for creating very small segments in database.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.CreateLine ( P1,
P2)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT) P1 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x1, y1, z1) in meters that describe the first point of the line |
| Input: | (VARIANT) P2 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles (x2, y2, z2) in meters that describe the second point of the line |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if success, FALSE if fail |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->ICreateLine (
P1, P2 )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double\*) P1 | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x1, y1, z1) in meters that describe the first point of the line |
| Input: | (double\*) P2 | Pointer to an array of 3 doubles (x2, y2, z2) in meters that describe the second point of the line |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The ModelDoc::SetAddToDB method increases performance during entity
creation by adding entities directly to the SolidWorks database, and it
also avoids inferencing.
