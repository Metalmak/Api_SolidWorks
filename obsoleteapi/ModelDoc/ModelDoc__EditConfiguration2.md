# ModelDoc::EditConfiguration2

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc2::EditConfiguration2](../ModelDoc2/ModelDoc2__EditConfiguration2.htm).

Description

This method edits the named configuration. Any component added to your
assembly inherits  these
settings if this configuration is the active configuration. To edit the
configuration of an individual component, see AssemblyDoc::CompConfigProperties.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.EditConfiguration2
( name, newname, comment, alternateName, suppressByDefault, hideByDefault,
minFeatureManager, inheritProperties, flags )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BSTR) name | Name of the configuration to edit |
| Input: | (BSTR) newname | New name for the configuration, if desired, or a NULL string |
| Input: | (BSTR) comment | Comment string for documenting your configuration |
| Input: | (BSTR) alternateName | Alternate name for Bill of Materials |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) suppressByDefault | TRUE if you want newly added components to be suppressed, FALSE otherwise |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) hideByDefault | TRUE if you want newly added components to be hidden, FALSE otherwise |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) minFeatureManager | TRUE if you want newly added components to only display their component name in the FeatureManager design tree. FALSE if you want newly added components to display their name and each of their features in the FeatureManager design tree |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) inheritProperties | TRUE if you want to inherit properties, FALSE if not |
| Input: | (ULONG) flags | Additional control |
| Return: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | TRUE if the configuration was edited successfully, FALSE if not |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->EditConfiguration2
( name, newname, comment, alternateName, suppressByDefault, hideByDefault,
minFeatureManager, inheritProperties, flags, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BSTR) name | Name of the configuration to edit |
| Input: | (BSTR) newname | New name for the configuration, if desired, or a NULL string |
| Input: | (BSTR) comment | Comment string for documenting your configuration |
| Input: | (BSTR) alternateName | Alternate name for Bill of Materials |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) suppressByDefault | TRUE if you want newly added components to be suppressed, FALSE otherwise |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) hideByDefault | TRUE if you want newly added components to be hidden, FALSE otherwise |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) minFeatureManager | TRUE if you want newly added components to only display their component name in the FeatureManager design tree. FALSE if you want newly added components to display their name and each of their features in the FeatureManager design tree |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) inheritProperties | TRUE if you want to inherit properties, FALSE if not |
| Input: | (ULONG) flags | Additional control |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | TRUE if the configuration was edited successfully, FALSE otherwise |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The flags argument allows additional control of the created configuration.
It can take the values from the ConfigurationFlags\_e enumeration in swoptions.h. These are:

* CONFIG\_USE\_ALTERNATENAME - When set indicates
  that the alternateName specified is used in the Bill of Materials.
* CONFIG\_DONT\_SHOW\_PARTS\_IN\_BOM - When set,
  specifies that sub-assemblies show in the Bill of Materials, otherwise
  the child components are listed in the Bill of Materials.
