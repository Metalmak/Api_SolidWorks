# ModelDoc::FeatureCutThin

This method is obsolete
and has been superseded by [ModelDoc2::FeatureCutThin](../ModelDoc2/ModelDoc2__FeatureCutThin.htm).

Description

This method creates a feature
by extruding a profile. A constant thickness is given to the profile during
extrusion. The result is then removed from the existing work piece.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

Remarks

The default direction for cut operations are opposite the sketch normal.
The default direction for boss operations is along the sketch normal.
Setting the dir argument to TRUE reverses the default direction. For double-ended
extrusions, Direction2 is always be opposite of Direction1.

The default sketch normal is the same as the face or plane normal where
the sketch was placed. To determine this normal vector, see Face::Normal
and RefPlane::GetRefPlaneParams, respectively.
