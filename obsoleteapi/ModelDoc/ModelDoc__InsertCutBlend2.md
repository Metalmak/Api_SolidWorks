# ModelDoc::InsertCutBlend2

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc::InsertCutBlend2](ModelDoc__InsertCutBlend3.htm).

Description

This method inserts a lofted cut based on the selected profiles and
guide curves. Selection of guide curves is optional; however, selection
of the profiles must be in an order consistent with the desired direction
of the loft.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc.InsertCutBlend2 ( closed,
keepTangency, forceNonRational)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BOOL) closed | TRUE if you want the loft to be closed, FALSE if the loft will be open; if TRUE, and if you have selected less that three profiles, then any selected guide curves must be closed curves |
| Input: | (BOOL) keepTangency | If the section curves are tangent, then you have the option to specify whether the resulting surfaces will also be tangent;  Specify TRUE to maintain the tangency as seen in the section curves, FALSE otherwise; when generating tangent surfaces, SolidWorks will maintain planar and cylindrical surface shapes if the section curves exhibit these characteristics. |
| Input: | (BOOL) forceNonRational | TRUE to force the resulting surface to be non-rational, FALSE otherwise |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->InsertCutBlend2
( closed, keepTangency, forceNonRational )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) closed | TRUE if you want the loft to be closed, FALSE if the loft will be open; if TRUE, and if you have selected less that three profiles, then any selected guide curves must be closed curves |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) keepTangency | If the section curves are tangent, then you have the option to specify whether the resulting surfaces will also be tangent; specify TRUE to maintain the tangency as seen in the section curves, FALSE otherwise; when generating tangent surfaces, SolidWorks will maintain planar and cylindrical surface shapes if the section curves exhibit these characteristics |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) forceNonRational | TRUE to force the resulting surface to be non-rational, FALSE otherwise |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Use of guide curves is recommended when selecting profiles in the FeatureManager
design tree.

You can use any number of profiles; however, if you have selected less
that three profiles, then any selected guide curves must be closed curves.

Use a SelectByMark method to select the profiles and guide curves. The
mark for the profile selections
should be a 1, while the mark for any guide curve selection, if provided,
should be a 2.
