# ModelDoc::InsertFeatureShellAddThickness

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::InsertFeatureShellAddThickness.

Description

This method adds thickness to a face in multi-thickness
shell feature. This method modifies the behavior of ModelDoc::InsertFeatureShell
so that a multi-thickness shell is created.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc.InsertFeatureShellAddThickness
( thickness )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) thickness | Shell thickness in meters |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->InsertFeatureShellAddThickness
( thickness )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) thickness | Shell thickness in meters |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Make selections for the shell feature using SelectByMark
with a mark number of 1 for the removed faces and 2 for the faces that
have the alternate thicknesses. Call this function once for each of the
faces that have selection with a mark of 2, then call ModelDoc::InsertFeatureShell.
