# ModelDoc::FeatureRevolveCut2

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc2::FeatureRevolveCut2](../ModelDoc2/ModelDoc2__FeatureRevolveCut2.htm).

Description

This method creates a revolved feature cut. For extruded feature cuts,
see ModelDoc::FeatureCut.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.FeatureRevolveCut2
( angle, reverseDir, angle2, revType, Options)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) angle | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (BOOL) reverseDir | angle is positive or negative ( TRUE or FALSE) |
| Input: | (double) angle2 | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (long) revType | Type of revolution, where:  1 = MidPlane revolution. For this type of revolve, the angle specification specifies the full revolution. The angle to be revolved is (angle/2 ) on either side of the sketch. The reverseDir argument has no affect.  2 = Two direction revolution. For a two direction revolve, the angle is the angle to be revolved in direction 1 and angle2 is the angle to be revolved in direction 2. |
| Input: | (long) Options | Additional control |
| Return: | (long) retval | 0 for no error |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->FeatureRevolveCut2(
angle, reverseDir, angle2, revType, Options, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) angle | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) reverseDir | angle is positive or negative ( TRUE or FALSE) |
| Input: | (double) angle2 | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (long) revType | Type of revolution, where:  1 = MidPlane revolution. For this type of revolve, the angle specification specifies the full revolution. The angle to be revolved is (angle/2 ) on either side of the sketch. The reverseDir argument has no affect.  2 = Two direction revolution. For a two direction revolve, the angle is the angle to be revolved in direction 1 and angle2 is the angle to be revolved in direction 2. |
| Input: | (long) Options | Additional control |
| Output: | (long) retval | 0 for no error |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The options argument allows additional control of the feature creation.
Supported values are listed in swoptions.h.
