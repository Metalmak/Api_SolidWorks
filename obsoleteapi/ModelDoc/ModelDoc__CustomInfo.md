Remarks

In line with Microsoft recommendations for OLE support, the file summary
information for SolidWorks documents is written as an OLE property set
into a stream named "\005Summary Information" off the root storage
of the SolidWorks document's compound file

NOTE:
MFC does not currently provide classes that manage summary information.
However, the DRAWCLI application shipped with Visual C++ does include
a sample implementation, in the form of the class CSummInfo, which you
can use as an example when implementing your own. This class is used by
the document class CDrawDoc. DRAWCLI also includes property pages for
displaying and modifying summary information.
