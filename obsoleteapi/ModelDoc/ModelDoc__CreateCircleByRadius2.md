# ModelDoc::CreateCircleByRadius2

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc2::CreateCircleByRadius2](../ModelDoc2/ModelDoc2__CreateCircleByRadius2.htm).

Description

This method creates a circle based on a center
point and a specified radius.

Syntax (OLE
Automation)

retval
= ModelDoc.CreateCircleByRadius2 ( xc,
yc, zc,
radius )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) xc | X value of the circle center point, in meters |
| Input: | (double) yc | Y value of the circle center point, in meters |
| Input: | (double) zc | Z value of the circle center point, in meters |
| Input: | (double) radius | Radius of the circle, in meters |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to the Dispatch object of the circle that was created |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->ICreateCircleByRadius2
( xc, yc,
zc, radius,
&retval
)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) xc | X value of the circle center point, in meters |
| Input: | (double) yc | Y value of the circle center point, in meters |
| Input: | (double) zc | Z value of the circle center point, in meters |
| Input: | (double) radius | Radius of the circle, in meters |
| Output: | (LPSKETCHSEGMENT) retval | Pointer to the circle that was created |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method creates a full circle in the active
2D sketch. If a sketch is not active, then a new sketch will be created.
You can check for an active sketch using the ModelDoc::GetActiveSketch2
function.

For COM
applications, the object pointer returned from this method can be used
to call any APIs
on the SketchSegment
interface. The underlying SketchArc
object can be obtained using QueryInterface
on the returned SketchSegment
object.

OLE
applications can simply define a new SketchSegment
or SketchArc
object using the returned dispatch pointer. Visual Basic applications
will interpret the pointer for you automatically, so you can use the returned
object to call SketchSegment
or SketchArc
functions.

ModelDoc::SetAddToDB
and ModelDoc::SetDisplayWhenAdded
increase performance during entity creation by adding entities directly
to the SolidWorks
database.

ModelDoc::SetAddToDB
avoids some of the peculiarities involved with creating entities via the
user interface, such as inferencing, automatic relations, and snapping
to the grid. Adding entities directly to the database also significantly
increases the performance of this API. When you are done creating entities,
it is important to call  ModelDoc::SetAddToDB(False),
to restore SolidWorks to its normal operating mode.

This API also works in conjunction with [ModelDoc::SetDisplayWhenAdded](ModelDoc__SetDisplayWhenAdded.htm).
If you have called [ModelDoc::SetAddToDB](ModelDoc__SetAddToDB.htm)(True),
additional performance can be gained by calling [ModelDoc::SetDisplayWhenAdded](ModelDoc__SetDisplayWhenAdded.htm)(False)
to disable immediate display of entities as they are added to the database.
When you are done creating all of your sketch entities, you will need
to redraw your document window (refer to [ModelDoc::GraphicsRedraw2](ModelDoc__GraphicsRedraw2.htm))
to see the entities you've added. You should also restore the original
display settings by calling [ModelDoc::SetDisplayWhenAdded](ModelDoc__SetDisplayWhenAdded.htm)(True).

The create a circle using a center point and a
point on the circle, refer to [ModelDoc::CreateCircle2](ModelDoc__CreateCircle2.htm).
To create a partial arc, refer to ModelDoc::CreateArc2.
