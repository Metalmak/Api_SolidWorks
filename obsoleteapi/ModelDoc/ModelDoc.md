In SolidWorks, there are three main document types: parts, drawings
and assemblies. Each document type has its own API object (PartDoc, DrawingDoc
and AssemblyDoc) with its own set of related functions. For example, the
Assembly::AddComponent function exists on the AssemblyDoc object because
adding components is specific to assembly documents.

The SolidWorks API also has functions that are common to all document
types. For example, printing, saving or determining the file name associated
with a document would be common operations. To expose common document-level
functions, the SolidWorks API uses the ModelDoc object.

The ModelDoc object provides direct access to the PartDoc, DrawingDoc
and AssemblyDoc Objects. This is important to recognize. For COM applications,
it means the ModelDoc object can be obtained from any of these three objects
using QueryInterface. Likewise, based on the type of document represented
by the ModelDoc pointer, the related PartDoc, DrawingDoc or AssemblyDoc
object can be obtained from the ModelDoc object also using QueryInterface.
To determine which underlying interface is supported, you can use standard
QueryInterface techniques, or you can use ModelDoc::GetType.

For OLE applications, this relationship means you can simply define
a new IModelDoc object which uses the same dispatch pointer as your IPartDoc,
IDrawingDoc, or IAssemblyDoc object. Likewise, given a part document,
you can use its ModelDoc dispatch pointer to define a new PartDoc object.
Before doing this, and before calling a function which is on one of the
underlying objects, you should verify the document type using ModelDoc::GetType.
If, for example, ModelDoc::GetType indicates that this ModelDoc object
represents an assembly, then it is safe to use the dispatch pointer to
define a new IAssemblyDoc object and to call any of the AssemblyDoc functions.

NOTE: Visual Basic applications
will interpret the pointer for you automatically. This means you can simply
use the given document object to call any ModelDoc function or, based
on the document type, to call any of the PartDoc, DrawingDoc or AssemblyDoc
functions.
