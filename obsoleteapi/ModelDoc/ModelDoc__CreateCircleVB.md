# ModelDoc::CreateCircleVB

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc::CreateCircle2](ModelDoc__CreateCircle2.htm).

Description

This method creates a circle using a center point and another point
on the circle, which helps determine the radius. This point also enables
any automatic relations, snapping to the grid, and so on, depending on
its location. This method is for use in Visual Basic and other forms of
Basic that do not support SafeArrays.
