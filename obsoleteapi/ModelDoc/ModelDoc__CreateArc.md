# ModelDoc::CreateArc

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc::CreateArc2](ModelDoc__CreateArc2.htm).

Description

This method creates an arc from P1 as center, from P2 to P3. You can
use ModelDoc::CreateArcVB in Visual Basic and other forms of Basic that
do not support SafeArrays.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.CreateArc ( P1, P2,
P3, dir)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT) P1 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles(x1, y1, z1) in meters that describe the center point of the arc |
| Input: | (VARIANT) P2 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles(x2, y2, z2) in meters that describe the first point of the arc |
| Input: | (VARIANT) P3 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles(x2, y2, z2) in meters that describe the second point of the arc |
| Input: | (short) dir | Direction of arc ( +1 or -1) |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if successful, FALSE if not |

Syntax
(COM)

status = ModelDoc->ICreateArc (
P1, P2, P3, dir )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) P1 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles(x1, y1, z1) in meters that describe the center point of the arc |
| Input: | (double) P2 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles(x2, y2, z2) in meters that describe the first point of the arc |
| Input: | (double) P3 | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 3 doubles(x2, y2, z2) in meters that describe the second point of the arc |
| Input: | (short) dir | Direction of arc ( +1 or -1) |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method enables automatic relations for an arc, which may not be
suitable for creating very small arcs in database.
