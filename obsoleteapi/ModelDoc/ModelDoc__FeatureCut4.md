# ModelDoc::FeatureCut4

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc2::FeatureCut4](../ModelDoc2/ModelDoc2__FeatureCut4.htm).

Description

This method creates a cut feature in this model
document.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc.FeatureCut4 ( sd, flip, dir, t1, t2,
d1, d2, dchk1, dchk2, ddir1, ddir2, dang1, dang2, offsetReverse1, offsetReverse2,
keepPieceIndex, normalCut)

| Input: | (BOOL) sd | TRUE for single ended, FALSE for double ended |
| Input: | (BOOL) flip | Flip side to cut.; TRUE if you want to remove the material outside of the profile |
| Input: | (BOOL) dir | Reverse direction; TRUE if you want Direction1 to be opposite the default direction |
| Input: | (long) t1 | Termination type for first end as defined in swEndConditions\_e |
| Input: | (long) t2 | Termination type for second end as defined in swEndConditions\_e |
| Input: | (double) d1 | Depth of extrusion for first end in meters |
| Input: | (double) d2 | Depth of extrusion for second end in meters |
| Input: | (BOOL) dchk1 | TRUE allows draft angle in first direction, FALSE does not allow drafting |
| Input: | (BOOL) dchk2 | TRUE allows draft angle in second direction, FALSE does not allow drafting |
| Input: | (BOOL) ddir1 | For first draft angle to be inward use TRUE, for draft angle outward use FALSE |
| Input: | (BOOL) ddir2 | For second draft angle to be inward use TRUE, for draft angle outward use FALSE |
| Input: | (double) dang1 | Draft angle for first end |
| Input: | (double) dang2 | Draft angle for second end |
| Input: | (BOOL) offsetReverse1 | If you chose to offset the first end condition from another face or plane, then TRUE specifies offset in direction away from the sketch and FALSE specifies offset from the face or plane in a direction toward the sketch. |
| Input: | (BOOL) offsetReverse2 | If you chose to offset the second end condition from another face or plane, then TRUE specifies offset in direction away from the sketch and FALSE specifies offset from the face or plane in a direction toward the sketch. |
| Input: | (long) keepPieceIndex | Piece to keep if there is ambiguity |
| Input: | (BOOL) normalCut | TRUE uses the normal cut option, FALSE does not; this parameter applies only to sheet metal parts; non-sheet metal parts should use FALSE; when adding a cut to the folded sheet metal part, you can set this parameter to TRUE to ensure that the cut is created normal to the sheet metal thickness |

Remarks

The default direction for cut operations are opposite
the sketch normal. The default direction for boss operations is along
the sketch normal. Setting the dir argument to TRUE will reverse the default
direction. For double-ended extrusions, Direction2 will always be opposite
to Direction1.

The default sketch normal will be the same as the
face or plane normal where the sketch was placed. To determine this normal
vector, use Face2::Normal and RefPlane::GetRefPlaneParams, respectively.

When there is ambiguity in the result of a cut,
the keepPieceIndex is used to resolve which of the possible results is
used. This can be set to -1 if there is no ambiguity; otherwise, it should
be the index of the result, starting from 0 (up to 1 less than the possible
number of outcomes).
