# ModelDoc::GetSaveFlag

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::GetSaveFlag.

Description

This method determines whether the document is currently
dirty and needs to be saved.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.GetSaveFlag
( )

| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if this document needs to be saved, FALSE if not |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->GetSaveFlag
( &retval )

| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | TRUE if this document needs to be saved, FALSE if not |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This flag is used by SolidWorks to determine if
the Do you wish to save changes
dialog should be displayed when the user tries to close the document.
Many operations in SolidWorks cause this flag to be set, and ModelDoc::SetSaveFlag
can also be used to set this flag.

If you use this method to check the state of an
assembly, SolidWorks sets this flag to TRUE for assemblies only when a
sub-assembly has been saved. Even if this flag is set to TRUE for a subassembly,
SolidWorks does not mark the assembly as dirty until the subassembly is
saved.

After the user has saved the file, this flag is
reset to FALSE.
