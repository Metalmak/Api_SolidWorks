# ModelDoc::FeatureCut

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc::FeatureCut2](ModelDoc__FeatureCut2.htm).

Description

This method creates an extruded feature cut. For making revolved cuts,
use  [ModelDoc::FeatureRevolveCut2](ModelDoc__FeatureRevolveCut2.htm).

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc.FeatureCut
( sd, flip, dir, t1, t2, d1, d2, dchk1, dchk2, ddir1, ddir2, dang1, dang2,
offsetReverse1, offsetReverse2)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BOOL) sd | TRUE for single ended, FALSE for double ended |
| Input: | (BOOL) flip | TRUE to flip the direction to cut |
| Input: | (BOOL) dir | TRUE to flip direction to extrude |
| Input: | (long) t1 | Termination type for first end |
| Input: | (long) t2 | Termination type for second end |
| Input: | (double) d1 | Depth of extrusion for first end in meters |
| Input: | (double) d2 | Depth of extrusion for second end in meters |
| Input: | (BOOL) dchk1 | TRUE allows draft angle in first direction, FALSE does not allow drafting |
| Input: | (BOOL) dchk2 | TRUE allows draft angle in second direction, FALSE does not allow drafting |
| Input: | (BOOL) ddir1 | For first draft angle to be inward use TRUE, for draft angle outward use FALSE |
| Input: | (BOOL) ddir2 | For second draft angle to be inward use TRUE, for draft angle outward use FALSE |
| Input: | (double) dang1 | Draft angle for first end |
| Input: | (double) dang2 | Draft angle for second end |
| Input: | (BOOL) offsetReverse1 | I you chose to offset the first end condition from another face or plane, then TRUE specifies offset in direction away from the sketch and FALSE specifies offset from the face or plane in a direction toward the sketch |
| Input: | (BOOL) offsetReverse2 | if you chose to offset the second end condition from another face or plane, then TRUE specifies offset in direction away from the sketch and FALSE specifies offset from the face or plane in a direction toward the sketch |

Syntax (COM)

| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) sd | TRUE for single ended, FALSE for double ended |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) flip | TRUE to flip the direction to cut |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) dir | TRUE to flip direction to extrude |
| Input: | (long) t1 | Termination type for first end |
| Input: | (long) t2 | Termination type for second end |
| Input: | (double) d1 | Depth of extrusion for first end in meters |
| Input: | (double) d2 | Depth of extrusion for second end in meters |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) dchk1 | TRUE allows draft angle in first direction, FALSE does not allow drafting |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) dchk2 | TRUE allows draft angle in second direction, FALSE does not allow drafting |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) ddir1 | For first draft angle to be inward use TRUE, for draft angle outward use FALSE |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) ddir2 | For second draft angle to be inward use TRUE, for draft angle outward use FALSE |
| Input: | (double) dang1 | Draft angle for first end |
| Input: | (double) dang2 | Draft angle for second end |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) offsetReverse1 | if you chose to offset the first end condition from another face or plane, then TRUE specifies offset in direction away from the sketch and FALSE would specify offset from the face or plane in a direction toward the sketch |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) offsetReverse2 | if you chose to offset the second end condition from another face or plane, then TRUE specifies offset in direction away from the sketch and FALSE would specify offset from the face or plane in a direction toward the sketch |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Termination type may be any of the values as defined in swEndConditions\_e.
