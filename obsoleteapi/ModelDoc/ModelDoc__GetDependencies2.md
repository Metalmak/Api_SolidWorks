# ModelDoc::GetDependencies2

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::GetDependencies2.

Description

This method gets all of the model dependencies.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.GetDependencies2 ( traverseFlag, searchFlag, addReadOnlyInfo )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BOOL) traverseFlag | TRUE if you wish to traverse down into all dependent files, FALSE if you want only the highest level within the dependencies |
| Input: | (BOOL) searchFlag | TRUE if you wish to use the search rules to find dependencies, FALSE looks where the documents were last saved |
| Input: | (BOOL) addReadOnlyInfo | TRUE if you wish to show read-only information in the returned strings |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray of strings; there will be two strings for each document returned in this list of dependent files; the first is the file name and the second is the filename with the complete path name; this combination repeats itself for each dependent file found for this ModelDoc |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->IGetDependencies2 ( traverseflag,
searchflag, addReadOnlyInfo, retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) traverseFlag | TRUE if you wish to traverse down into all dependent files, FALSE if you want only the highest level within the dependencies |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) searchFlag | TRUE if you wish to use the search rules to find dependencies, FALSE looks where the documents were last saved |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) addReadOnlyInfo | TRUE if you wish to show read-only information in the returned strings |
| Output: | (BSTR\*) retval | Array of strings; there will be two strings for each document returned in this list of dependent files; the first is the file name and the second is the filename with the complete path name; this combination repeats itself for each dependent file found for this ModelDoc |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Calling this method on a drawing document returns
a list of all the part and assemblies used in the drawing. If you set
the traverseFlag to TRUE, then each of the parts within the assembly file
are also returned in this array of strings.

Because a derived mirror part is generated from another part, the list
of model dependencies returned by this method would include the original
configuration the part used to generate the derived mirror part.

Library features are completely unassociated. They do not require the
library nor do they update when changes are made to the library feature.
Therefore, this method does not return library features.

For the COM implementation, call ModelDoc::GetNumDependencies first
to determine the number of strings to be returned.

If you use this methodwith an assembly that contains two documents,
Part1 and SubAssem1,
an example of what might be returned is:

[ "Part1",
"C:\temp\Part1.SLDPRT", "SubAssem1", "c:\temp\SubAssem1.SLDASM"
]

If traverseFlag
is set to TRUE, then all of the documents contained in SubAssem1.ASM
are  also
returned. Suppressed components are still recognized and returned by this
method as a dependent file.

NOTE: The return value for file
references for assemblies containing suppressed or lightweight components
point to the as-saved component reference because the actual component
is not loaded into memory. Because the suppressed and lightweight components
are not actually loaded, SolidWorks does not apply current search criteria
to update the file references. Setting the SearchFlag argument to TRUE
vs. FALSE, causes this method to apply the current search criteria rules
to locate the particular reference and may result in a different return
value. Likewise, unsuppressing or resolving these components causes SolidWorks
to apply the current search criteria and update the assembly's component
references in memory, if necessary.

When calling this method with the seachFlag argument set to TRUE, you
may want to explicitly set the search folders first. This is important
because this method uses the current SolidWorks directory as its second
search criteria. Because the user may have interactively opened files
from some random directory, you cannot be certain that the current SolidWorks
directory is pointing at the desired location. You may want to set the
search folders to that of the document used. For example:

// Get the current search folder settings so we can reset them later

 VARIANT\_BOOL currentSearchFolderSetting = FALSE;

 BSTR currentSearchFolders = NULL;

 hres = TheApplication->m\_pSldWorks->GetUserPreferenceToggle
( swUseFolderSearchRules, &currentSearchFolderSetting );

 hres = TheApplication->m\_pSldWorks->GetSearchFolders ( swDocumentType,
&currentSearchFolders );

// Set the search folders to use the path of the document

 BSTR bdocName;

 hres = pModelDoc->GetPathName(&bdocName);

 CString docName(bdocName);

 VARIANT\_BOOL ok = FALSE;

 CString searchFolder = getFileLocation(docName); //
Function to extract directory from full filename

 hres = TheApplication->m\_pSldWorks->SetSearchFolders
( swDocumentType, au2B(searchFolder), &ok );

// Reset search folders to previous values

 hres = TheApplication->m\_pSldWorks->SetUserPreferenceToggle
( swUseFolderSearchRules, currentSearchFolderSetting );

 hres = TheApplication->m\_pSldWorks->SetSearchFolders
( swDocumentType, currentSearchFolders, &ok );
