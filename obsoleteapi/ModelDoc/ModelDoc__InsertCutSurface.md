# ModelDoc::InsertCutSurface

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::InsertCutSurface.

Description

This method creates a surface cut feature.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc.InsertCutSurface ( flip,
keepPieceIndex )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BOOL) flip | TRUE to flip the direction |
| Input: | (long) keepPieceIndex | Piece to keep if there is ambiguity |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->InsertCutSurface
( flip, keepPieceIndex )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) flip | TRUE to flip the direction |
| Input: | (long) keepPieceIndex | Piece to keep if there is ambiguity |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method creates a cut from a selected surface.

When there is ambiguity in the result of a cut, the keepPieceIndex is
used to resolve which of the possible results is used. This can be set
to -1 if there is no ambiguity; otherwise, it should be the index of the
result, starting from 0 (up to 1 less than the possible number of outcomes).
