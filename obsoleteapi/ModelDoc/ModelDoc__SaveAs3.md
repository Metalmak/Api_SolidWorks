# ModelDoc::SaveAs3

This method is obsolete
and has been superseded by [ModelDoc2::SaveAs3](../ModelDoc2/ModelDoc2__SaveAs3.htm).

Description

This method saves the document with a new name.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.SaveAs3 ( newName, saveAsVersion,
options )

#

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BSTR) newName | New name of the document; the file extension will indicate any conversion that should be performed (for example, Part1.igs to save to IGES) |
| Input: | (long) saveAsVersion | See swSaveAsVersion\_e for valid options |
| Input: | (long) options | See swSaveAsVersion\_e for valid options |
| Output: | (long) retval | 0 if no errors during save; otherwise, errors occurred |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->SaveAs3 ( newName, saveAsVersion,
options, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BSTR) newName | New name of the document; the file extension will indicate any conversion that should be performed (for example, Part1.igs to save to IGES) |
| Input: | (long) saveAsVersion | See swSaveAsVersion\_e for valid options |
| Input: | (long) options | See swSaveAsVersion\_e for valid options |
| Output: | (long) retval | 0 if no errors during save; otherwise, errors occurred |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The options argument is a
bitmask containing various BOOLEANS that affect the outcome of the document
saving.

If the file was saved successfully, then retval will have the value 0; otherwise,
it will contain a bitwise OR of the error codes that were generated in
saving the document. The masks to check against can be found in the swFileSaveError\_e
enumeration.

This method overwrites existing files on disk unless
they are read-only.

This method results in FileSaveAsNotify being sent
to any application listening.

To save a file using its current name, see ModelDoc::Save2.
