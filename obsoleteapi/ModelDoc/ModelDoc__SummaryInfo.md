Remarks

In line with Microsoft recommendations for OLE support, the file summary
information for SolidWorks documents is written as an OLE property set
into a stream named "\005Summary Information" off the root storage
of the SolidWorks document's compound file.

NOTE: MFC does not currently
provide classes that manage summary information. However, the DRAWCLI
application shipped with Visual C++ does include a sample implementation,
in the form of the class CSummInfo, which you can use as an example when
implementing your own. This class is used by the document class CDrawDoc.
DRAWCLI also includes property pages for displaying and modifying summary
information.
