# ModelDoc::SketchSplineByEqnParams

This method is obsolete
and has been superseded by [ModelDoc2::SketchSplineByEqnParams](../ModelDoc2/ModelDoc2__SketchSplineByEqnParams.htm).

Description

This method creates a spline on the active 2D sketch using the Bcurve
parameters provided. For use with Visual Basic, see ModelDoc::SketchSplineByEqnParams2.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.SketchSplineByEqnParams
( paramsIn )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT) paramsIn | VARIANT of type SafeArray containing an array of doubles |
| Return: | (BOOLEAN) retval | TRUE if created successfully |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->ISketchSplineByEqnParams
( propArray, knotsArray, cntrlPntCoordArray, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (int\*) propArray | Includes dimension, order, number of control points, periodicity |
| Input: | (double\*) knotsArray | knot1, knot2, and so on |
| Input: | (double\*) cntrlPntCoordArray | controlpoint1[dimension], controlpoint2[dimension], and so on |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | TRUE if created successfully |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The propArray argument contains 4 integers (packed into the first two
doubles in the SafeArray):

* Dimension
* Order
* Number of control points
* Periodicity ( TRUE or FALSE )

The knotsArray argument is an array of doubles with (Number of Control
Points + Order) elements.

The size of the cntrlPntCoordArray array is based upon the curve dimension.

* Dimension
  = 2 then each control point is an array of 2 doubles ( x, y )
* Dimension
  = 3 then each control point is an array of 3 doubles ( x, y, z)
* Dimension
  = 4 then each control point is an array of 4 doubles ( x, y, z, w ) where
  w = weight

The parameters are provided as 3 arrays, which for COM applications
are passed separately and for OLE automation are packed into a single
SafeArray, which is packed as follows:

[ packedDouble1,
packedDouble2, knot1, knot2,...,ControlPoint1[Dimension], ControlPoint2[Dimension],...
]

Control point coordinates should be passed to this routine in sketch
space. The Z value is interpreted as 0. In certain situations, you must
transform your Bcurve parameters to sketch space with the help of Sketch::ModelToSketchXform.

Note: If the spline being generated
is a closed spline, then it must be flagged as periodic. In addition,
splines generated in sketches must be G1 continuous. If the data passed
to this method does not generate a G1 continuous spline, then it is rejected
and no spline is created.
