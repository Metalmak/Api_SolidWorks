# ModelDoc::GetTessellationQuality

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::GetTessellationQuality.

Description

This method gets  the
tessellation quality index for the application.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.GetTessellationQuality
()

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (long) retval | Number between 0 and 100 that indicates the quality of tessellation to use for this part; a higher index means finer tessellation |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->GetTessellationQuality
( &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |

Remarks

This method returns the shaded-display quality setting that you find
on the Tools, Options,  Performance
menu. The numeric deviation value changes based on the current part. This
deviation is calculated as follows:

Deviation = 0.025 \* (BodyDiameter)
/ qualityIndex;

where the BodyDiameter
is the diagonal distance across the bounds of the part box. See PartDoc::GetPartBox
for details.

The Deviation value is in meters.
