# ModelDoc::IGet3rdPartyStorage

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::IGet3rdPartyStorage.

Description

This method gets an IStream interface for storage inside the SolidWorks
document.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

Not Available.

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->IGet3rdPartyStorage
( stringIn, isStoring, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BSTR) stringIn | Name for the storage stream; the name should be less than 30 characters and must be unique and qualified among all parties choosing to store within the current session |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) isStoring | TRUE if you are storing data, FALSE if you are reading data |
| Output: | (LPUNKNOWN) retval | Pointer to an unknown type, the IStream storage |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Call this interface when a SaveToStorageNotify or LoadFromStorageNotify
notification is received. Do not call this method to save or load from
storage in reaction to the FileSaveNotify or FileOpenNotify
events.

During a File, Open operation,
your application receives a LoadFromStorageNotify event if you have registered
for document notifications.  After
you receive this event, it is safe to open your Stream for reading using
this method. After a file is fully loaded, SolidWorks allows you to call
this method for reading your data at any time. This provides you with
access to read your storage node whenever needed. However, it is not a
good idea to attempt this while SolidWorks is in the middle of a FileSaveNotify
or FileOpenNotify as unforeseen conflicts may occur.

If your application is loaded in the middle of a SolidWorks session,
then you can traverse all open documents using SldWorks::EnumDocuments
or SldWorks::GetFirstDocument or SldWorks::GetNext and read the storage
from all existing open documents. From that point on, your application
can use the LoadFromStorageNotify event to recognize when new documents
have been opened and may need reading.

For storage writing, the IGet3rdPartyStorage interface is locked unless
the SaveToStorageNotify event has been sent. Therefore, you can only write
to your storage when the file is actually being saved by SolidWorks and
your application has received the SaveToStorageNotify event.

A call to IGet3rdPartyStorage must be followed by a call to ModelDoc::IRelease3rdPartyStorage.
This must be done even when you fail to obtain a Stream and the return
value from ModelDoc::IGet3rdPartyStorage is NULL. If you fail to call
ModelDoc::IRelease3rdPartyStorage, the 3rdParty node may remain locked
and prevent future access. You are not required to call ModelDoc::IRelease3rdPartyStorage,
under any circumstance, if you have called ModelDoc::IGet3rdPartyStorage
in reaction to one of the SaveToStorageNotify or LoadFromStorageNotify
events. However, it will not cause problems if you call ModelDoc::IRelease3rdPartyStorage
excessively.

As work progresses during an active session and you have information
that needs to be stored, you may want to flag the document as dirty using
ModelDoc::SetSaveFlag. This will cause a Save
Changes? prompt to appear if the user tries to close the file without
saving. If the user chooses Yes
to this prompt, then your application will receive the SaveToStorageNotify
event.

NOTE: The name to give to the
storage stream should be registered with SolidWorks so that no conflicts
occur. Once registered, SolidWorks reserves the stream name exclusively
for your application.

Passing the unique name string and a flag to determine if data is being
stored or being loaded returns an IUnknown pointer. You must then use
QueryInterface() to get the IStream interface. The stream is to be used
for serialization and then released in the third-party code.

The IStream object used by the third party is written to IStream objects
under an IStorage object called ThirdPty in the SolidWorks compound document.
Each third party writes to a single IStream object whose name is assigned
by SolidWorks.

NOTE
If you are using serialization, then you should be careful with
the standard MFC macros; otherwise, you may get messages like Unexpected
File Format after your application is unloaded.

One way of using IMPLEMENT\_SERIAL is:

IMPLEMENT\_SERIAL( CCustomAttr, CObject, VERSIONABLE\_SCHEMA|0 )
