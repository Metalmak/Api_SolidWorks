# ModelDoc::ResetBlockingState

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::ResetBlockingState.

Description

This method resets
the blocking state for the SolidWorks menus.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

(void) ModelDoc.ResetBlockingState
( )

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->ResetBlockingState
( )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method should be called after ModelDoc::SetBlockingState to set
the SolidWorks menus back to their previous state.

NOTE:
There must be a corresponding call to this method for every call to ModelDoc::SetBlocking
state. It is not enough to call this method once at the end of a sequence
of operations that have called ModelDoc::SetBlockingState several times.
