Remarks

When the user clicks the a right-mouse button (RMB)
on an entity in the graphics window, the user is presented with one of
two distinct menu sets. These menu sets are defined as mode 0 and mode
1:

#### Mode

0 – Default RMB
mode. This will present user with options to Select
Other, manipulate the view, access the properties dialog of the
selected item, and so on.

1 – The user is
presented with a limited set of choices including Select
Other and Clear Selection.
This mode is seen typically when a SolidWorks dialog is active and the
user is restricted to entity selection.

Using ModelDoc::SetPopupMenuMode, your application
can simulate the same RMB menu behavior as SolidWorks. If you have a dialog
that requires user selection of entities, you can set the popup menu mode
to 1 to simulate SolidWorks behavior. You should always set the menu mode
back to its previous value. Call ModelDoc::GetPopupMenuMode to determine
the previous value prior to calling ModelDoc::SetPopupMenuMode.
