Description

This method sets the spotlight properties.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.SetSpotlightProperties ( name,
ambient, diffuse, specular, color, enabled, fixed, x, y, z, xTarget, yTarget,
zTarget )

| Input: | (BSTR) name | Light name to be modified |
| Input: | (double) ambient | Light source ambient value |
| Input: | (double) diffuse | Light source diffuse value |
| Input: | (double) specular | Light source specular value |
| Input: | (long) color | COLORREF color value |
| Input: | (BOOL) enabled | TRUE if a light is enabled |
| Input: | (BOOL) fixed | TRUE if a light is fixed |
| Input: | (double) x | x location of the spotlight |
| Input: | (double) y | y location of the spotlight |

| Input: | (double) xTarget | x location of the spotlight target |
| Input: | (double) yTarget | y location of the spotlight target |
| Input: | (double) zTarget | z location of the spotlight target |
| Input: | (double) coneAngle | Cone angle through which the beam spreads in degrees |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if light properties were modified successfully |
