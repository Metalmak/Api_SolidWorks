# ModelDoc::GetFeatureCount

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::GetFeatureCount.

Description

This method returns the number of features in this document.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.GetFeatureCount ()

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (long) retval | Number of features in this document, excluding nay subfeatures |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->GetFeatureCount
( &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (long) retval | Number of features in this document, excluding nay subfeatures |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The number of features returned by this method
does not include subfeatures. Subfeatures include, for example, mate features
within a mate group, drawing views on a sheet,  and
so on. One way to identify a subfeature is whether it can be returned
by Feature::GetFirstSubFeature or Feature::GetNextSubFeature.

This method returns the number of features returned
when traversing the feature list with ModelDoc::FirstFeature and Feature::GetNextFeature.
This value may be useful in feature traversal or in accessing the feature
by position using ModelDoc::FeatureByPositionReverse.
