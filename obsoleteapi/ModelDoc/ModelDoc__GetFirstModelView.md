# ModelDoc::GetFirstModelView

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::GetFirstModelView.

Description

This method gets the first view in a model document.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.GetFirstModelView
( )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH)retval | Pointer to a Dispatch object, the first model view in this document |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->IGetFirstModelView
( &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (LPMODELVIEW) retval | Pointer to the first model view in this document |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if Successful, S\_FALSE if no model view is being returned |

Remarks

You can traverse through the model views in a document
by using this method to get the initial view, and ModelView::GetNext to
get each of the following views. When ModelView::GetNext returns NULL,
you have reached the end of the list.

See also [ModelDoc::EnumModelViews](ModelDoc__EnumModelViews.htm)
for a method for traversing the model views on a document.
