# ModelDoc::SetUnits

This method is obsolete
and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::SetUnits.

Description

This method sets the units used by the user for the model. This setting
does not affect the units used by the SolidWorks API, which consistently
requires and returns meters unless otherwise noted.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc.SetUnits ( uType, fractBase,
fractDenom, sigDigits, roundToFraction)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (short) uType | The desired model units as defined in swLengthUnit\_e |
| Input: | (short) fractBase | Decimal vs. fraction as defined in swFractionDisplay\_e |
| Input: | (short) fractDenom | Used only for fractional inches and is the denominator for the smallest fraction to be used; for example, 64 for 1/64 |
| Input: | (short) sigDigits | Significant digits if using decimal units |
| Input: | (BOOL) roundToFraction | Flag denoting whether or not to round to the fraction; for example, if 4 was the denominator value given in fractDenom and the actual value is 0.27, it would be rounded to 0.25 |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->SetUnits ( uType,
fractBase, fractDenom, sigDigits, roundToFraction)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (short) uType | The desired model units as defined in swLengthUnit\_e |
| Input: | (short) fractBase | Decimal vs. fraction as defined in swFractionDisplay\_e |
| Input: | (short) fractDenom | Used only for fractional inches and is the denominator for the smallest fraction to be used; for example, 64 for 1/64 |
| Input: | (short) sigDigits | Significant digits if using decimal units |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) roundToFraction | Fag denoting whether or not to round to the fraction; for example, if 4 was the denominator value given in fractDenom and the actual value is 0.27, it would be rounded to 0.25 |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Fractional units are only valid if uType is swINCHES or swFEETINCHES.
