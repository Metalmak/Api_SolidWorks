# ModelDoc::SelectionManager

This property is obsolete
and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::SelectionManager.

Description

This property makes the current selected object available to the user.
Selection Manager selected objects are transient since they will be invalid
as soon as another selection is made. So these pointers should not be
kept around for long.
