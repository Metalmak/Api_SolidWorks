# ModelDoc::InsertRevolvedRefSurface

This method is obsolete
and has been superseded by [ModelDoc2::InsertRevolvedRefSurface](../ModelDoc2/ModelDoc2__InsertRevolvedRefSurface.htm).

Description

The method creates a revolved reference surface
by revolving a profile around a centerline.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc.InsertRevolvedRefSurface
( Angle, ReverseDir, Angle2, RevType )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) Angle | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (BOOL) ReverseDir | Angle is positive or negative ( TRUE or FALSE) |
| Input: | (double) Angle2 | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (int) RevType | Type of revolution |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->InsertRevolvedRefSurface
( Angle, ReverseDir, Angle2, RevType )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) Angle | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) ReverseDir | Angle is positive or negative ( TRUE or FALSE) |
| Input: | (double) Angle2 | Angle of revolution in radians |
| Input: | (int) RevType | Type of revolution |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if Successful |

Remarks

This method is the same as interactively creating a planar surface by
selecting Insert, Reference Geometry,
Revolved Surface. See SolidWorks Help for more information about
what entities are valid for selection.

Make the selections using ModelDoc::SelectByID before
calling this function.

The RevType argument can be one of
the following values:

* 0 - One direction revolution.
* 1 - MidPlane revolution. For this type of
  revolve, the angle specification specifies the full revolution. The angle
  to be revolved is (angle/2 ) on either side of the sketch. The ReverseDir
  argument has no affect.
* 2 - Two direction revolution. For a two direction
  revolve, the angle is the angle to be revolved in direction 1 and angle2
  is the angle to be revolved in direction 2.
