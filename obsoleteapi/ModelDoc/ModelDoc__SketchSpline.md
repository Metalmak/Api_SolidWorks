# ModelDoc::SketchSpline

This method is obsolete
and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::SketchSpline.

Description

This method creates a spline, or continues
one, passing through the point (x, y, z). See also  ModelDoc::CreateSpline.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc.SketchSpline ( morePts,
x, y, z)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) morePts | Number of points left to specify after this point |
| Input: | (double) x | x coordinate of point in meters |
| Input: | (double) y | y coordinate of point in meters |
| Input: | (double) z | z coordinate of point in meters |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->SketchSpline
( morePts, x, y, z )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) morePts | Number of points left to specify after this point |
| Input: | (double) x | x coordinate of point in meters |
| Input: | (double) y | y coordinate of point in meters |
| Input: | (double) z | z coordinate of point in meters |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

If you are creating a sketch spline from a macro,
then you must use ModelDoc::SketchSpline. You cannot use ModelDoc::CreateSpline
because it requires an array of points.

In 2D sketches, SolidWorks ignores the z value.
