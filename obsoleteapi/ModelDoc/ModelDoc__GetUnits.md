# ModelDoc::GetUnits

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::GetUnits.

Description

This method gets the current unit settings, along with the fraction
base, the fraction value, and the significant digits being used. You can
also use ModelDoc::LengthUnit, which provides access to the LengthUnit
parameter.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.GetUnits ()

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (VARIANT) retval | VARIANT of type SafeArray of 5 shorts |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->IGetUnits ( &retval
)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (short) retval | Pointer to an array of 5 shorts |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The format of the returned data is an array of shorts:

[ LengthUnit,
FractionBase, FractionValue, SignificantDigits, RoundToFraction ]

where:

LengthUnit =  the current
model units as defined in swLengthUnit\_e.

FractionBase
=  decimal vs. fraction. This return is one of the
swFractionDisplay\_e enumerations. Fractional
units are only valid if the user has specified swINCHES or swFEETINCHES.

FractionValue
= the denominator value if using fractional units.

SignificantDigits =  the significant digits if using
decimal units.

RoundToFraction =  a flag denoting whether or not
to round the fraction. For example, if 4 was the
denominator value and the actual value was .27, then it would be rounded
to .25.
