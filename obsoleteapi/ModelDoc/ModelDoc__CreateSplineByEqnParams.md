# ModelDoc::CreateSplineByEqnParams

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc2::CreateSplineByEqnParams](../ModelDoc2/ModelDoc2__CreateSplineByEqnParams.htm).

Description

This method creates a spline using the specified
Bcurve parameters.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.CreateSplineByEqnParams ( paramsIn )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT) paramsIn | SafeArray containing an array of doubles to use in creating the spline |
| Return: | (LPDISPATCH) retval | Pointer to the Dispatch object of the spline that was created |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->ICreateSplineByEqnParams (
propArray, knotsArray, cntrlPntCoordArray, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (int\*) propArray | Includes dimension, order, number of control points,  and periodicity |
| Input: | (double\*) knotsArray | knot1, knot2, and so on |
| Input: | (double\*) cntrlPntCoordArray | controlpoint1[dimension], controlpoint2[dimension], and so on |
| Output: | (LPSKETCHSEGMENT) retval | Pointer to the spline that was created |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The propArray argument contains 4 integers (placed
in the first four doubles in the SafeArray):

* Dimension
* Order
* Number
  of Control Points
* Periodicity
  ( TRUE or FALSE )

The knotsArray argument is an array of doubles
with (Number of Control Points + Order) elements.

The size of the cntrlPntCoordArray array is based
upon the curve dimension.

* Dimension
  = 2 then each Control Point is an array of 2 doubles ( x, y )
* Dimension
  = 3 then each Control Point is an array of 3 doubles ( x, y, z)
* Dimension
  = 4 then each Control Point is an array of 4 doubles ( x, y, z, w ) where
  w = weight

The parameters are provided as 3 arrays, which
for OLE automation are packed into a single SafeArray, which is packed
as follows:

[
Dimension, Order, Number of control
Points, Periodicity, knot1, knot2,...,ControlPoint1[Dimension], ControlPoint2[Dimension],...
]

Pass control point coordinates  to
this routine in sketch space. The Z value is interpreted as 0. In certain
situations, you must transform your Bcurve parameters to sketch space
with the help of Sketch::ModelToSketchXform.

NOTE If
the spline generated is a closed spline, then it must be flagged as periodic.
Additionally, splines generated in sketches must be G1 continuous. If
the data passed to this method does not generate a G1 continuous spline,
then it is rejected and a spline is not created. If your data is not G1
continuous, then you must split the spline into multiple G1 segments and
call this method for each segment.

For the OLE interface, the object pointer returned
can be used directly to call any of the SketchSpline functions, or its
base class, SketchSegment. For the COM interface, the object pointer that
is returned can be used directly to call any of the SketchSegment funcitons
or use a  QueryInterface
to obtain the pointer to SketchSpline, and call any of the functions of
the SketchSpline interface.

This method does not work with the ModelDoc::SetAddToDB
or ModelDoc::SetDisplayWhenAdded. It always adds the spline directly to
the database as if ModelDoc::SetAddToDB(True) was in effect. You must
redraw your document window see the entities that you added , as if ModelDoc::SetDisplayWhenAdded(False)
was in effect.

To create 3D splines, use ModelDoc::InsertCurveFilePoint
and related functions.
