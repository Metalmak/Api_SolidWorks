# ModelDoc::SelectByID

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc2::SelectByID](../ModelDoc2/ModelDoc2__SelectByID.htm).

Description

This is a generic function for all selections in the system. With appropriate
input, it selects features, faces, edges, sketch items, and so on, at
the location specified.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.SelectByID ( objectName,
objectType, x, y, z)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BSTR) objectName | Name of object to select or an empty string |
| Input: | (BSTR) objectType | Type of object or an empty string (uppercase) |
| Input: | (double) x | X Selection location or 0 |
| Input: | (double) y | Y Selection location or 0 |
| Input: | (double) z | Z Selection location or 0 |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if item was successfully selected, FALSE otherwise |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->SelectByID (
objectName, objectType, x, y, z, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BSTR) objectName | Name of object to select or an empty string |
| Input: | (BSTR) objectType | Type of object or an empty string (uppercase) |
| Input: | (double) x | X Selection location,or 0 |
| Input: | (double) y | Y Selection location or 0 |
| Input: | (double) z | Z Selection location or 0 |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | TRUE if item was successfully selected, FALSE otherwise |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method resets the list of selected objects to contain only objects
that match the specified criteria. To append selections to the current
selection set, see ModelDoc::AndSelectByID.

If your application already has an object handle (for example, Face
Object, SketchSegment Object, and so on), use the appropriate Select method
to select the item directly using its handle.

To filter the objects that get selected by the ModelDoc::SelectByID
method, set the objectType argument as desired. This must be in uppercase.
If no specific type of object is required, then an empty string can be
passed in objectType; otherwise, this argument can  take
any of the values defined in the comments of the enumeration swSelectType\_e.

For example, to select an object of type swSelDIMENSIONS, you should
use the string that appears in the comment column, "DIMENSION".
Be aware that the objectType can change based on your current state.
For example, if you wish to select a sketch point that was created in
the active sketch, then you should specify the objectType
as "SKETCHPOINT". However, if you do not have an active
sketch or if the point was created in a sketch other than the active sketch,
then you should specify the objectType
as "EXTSKETCHPOINT".

If a type is specified in objectType, then this method returns FALSE
if it cannot find the matching object type.

The objectName argument is not intended for selection of faces, edges,
and so on. This is a case-sensitive string that is intended for objects
that are automatically named by SolidWorks during entity creation, such
as dimensions, drawing views, and so on. This method attempts to find
and select an object whose name matches the objectName string;  however,
the match must be exact for it to return a value of TRUE.

For example, if a string is passed that matches an object name but whose
case does not match exactly, this mehtod may return FALSE. For selection
of dimensions, the objectName argument needs to be fully qualified. For
example you must specify "D1@Sketch2@Part1.SLDPRT" rather than
simply "D1@Sketch2"; otherwise, this method  may
return FALSE. If you do not know the object name or if it is an item that
is not automatically named by SolidWorks, you can pass an empty string.

If you are using the objectName parameter,
then the XYZ coordinates should be in terms of the context where the item
was created. For example, if you want to select a sketch point and you
enter its name (for exmaple, "Point1") in the objectName parameter,
then you should give XYZ in terms of the sketch where the point was created.
Even if the sketch is not active, the XYZ values should be in terms of
sketch space if you are using the objectName parameter. In certain situations, you
can also pass in the XYZ coordinates as  0,0,0.
For example, to select an feature shown in the FeatureManager design tree,
you do not need to give an XYZ pick location. However, to select objects
such as notes or faces, or when you need a point location picked, you
must specify the XYZ coordinates.

If you are not using the objectName
parameter as a filter, then the XYZ coordinates should be in terms
of model space.

If you do not know the object name or the object type, pass in an empty
string to the objectName and the objectType parameters and the selection
routine will make its best attempt to select the correct object.

To get Face, Edge or Vertex objects by name, use the PartDoc::GetEntityByName
method.

The ModelDoc object being used to call this method must be an open and
visible document. For example, you cannot use the ModelDoc object returned
from an assembly component (Component::GetModelDoc) unless that actual
SolidWorks component part or subassembly is an open and visible document.
In this case, you could select the item using the fully qualified name
(for examp,e  "Plane4@Part1-1@Assem1").

When selecting Face objects, the supplied point is used as input to
the user-interface  selection
routines to use the speed of ray tracing. As a result, if the view changes
from the original recorded size or orientation or both, then the same
face cannot be selected upon replay. If your application has a pointer
to the Face object to be selected, then you can call the Entity::Select
method directly. Otherwise, you can call ModelDoc::SelectByRay. Calling
SelectByRay allows for tighter control over the starting point and the
direction in which to search.
