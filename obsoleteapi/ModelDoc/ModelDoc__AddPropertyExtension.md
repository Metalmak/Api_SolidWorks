# ModelDoc::AddPropertyExtension

This
method is obsolete and has been superseded by ModelDoc2::AddPropertyExtension.

Description

This method stores a float, string, or integer value with this document.
To do this, you must first define the VARIANT type (float, string, or
integer), give your variable a value, and then call this method to place
the value on the document for future reference.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = ModelDoc.AddPropertyExtension
( PropertyExtension)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT) PropertyExtension | Value you wish to store with the SolidWorks document |
| Return: | (long) retval | Unique identifier returned that allows access to this property extension in the future |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->AddPropertyExtension
( PropertyExtension, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (VARIANT) PropertyExtension | Value you wish to store with the SolidWorks document |
| Output: | (long) retval | Unique identifier returned that allows access to this property extension in the future |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

It is recommended that you use the Attribute, AttributeDef, and Parameter
classes instead of this method. These three classes provide more flexibility.
