# ModelDoc::SketchOffsetEntities

This
method is obsolete and is now superseded by [ModelDoc::SketchOffsetEntities2](ModelDoc__SketchOffsetEntities2.htm).

Description

This method generates entities in the active sketch by offsetting the
selected geometry by the specified amount.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc.SketchOffsetEntities
( offset, flip)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) offset | Offset distance in meters |
| Input: | (BOOL) flip | TRUE if the offset direction should be flipped, FALSE otherwise |

Syntax (COM)

status = ModelDoc->SketchOffsetEntities
( offset, flip )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (double) offset | Offset distance in meters |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) flip | TRUE if the offset direction should be flipped, FALSE otherwise |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

The geometry selected for offset can be an edge,
loop, face, external sketch curve, external sketch contour, set of edges,
or set of external sketch curves.

NOTE: If
the selected geometry is a sketch item, it must be an external sketch
curve; for example, it cannot be an item in the active sketch. To offset
sketch segments within the active sketch, use ModelDoc::SketchOffset.
