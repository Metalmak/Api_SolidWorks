# BlockDefinition::GetUseExternalFile

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by SketchBlockDefinition::LinkToFile.

Description

This method determines whether
this block definition is currently linked to an external file.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

UseFile = BlockDefinition.GetUseExternalFile ( )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (BOOL) UseFile | TRUE if this block definition is linked to an external file, FALSE if not |

Syntax (COM)

status = BlockDefinition->GetUseExternalFile (
&UseFile )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) UseFile | TRUE if this block definition is linked to an external file, FALSE if not |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method indicates whether the block definition
is linked to an external file, which you can enable or disable on the
block definition without destroying the file name. That is, the file name
continues to be stored even if the link is disabled.

To get the name of the external file, use BlockDefinition::GetExternalFileName.
To set the name of the external file and enable or disable the link, use
BlockDefinition::SetUseExternalFileName.
