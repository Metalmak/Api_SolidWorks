# BlockDefinition::GetExternalFileName

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by SketchBlockDefinition::FileName.

Description

This method gets the name of the file that
this block definition references.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

Filename = BlockDefinition.GetExternalFileName (
)

| Output: | (BSTR) Filename | Name of the file |

Syntax (COM)

status = BlockDefinition->GetExternalFileName
( &Filename )

| Output: | (BSTR) Filename | Name of the file |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method gets the name of the file with which
this block definition is associated, regardless of whether or not the
link is enabled. SolidWorks continues to store the name of the file if
the link is disabled.

Use BlockDefiniton::GetUseExternalFile to determine
whether this block definition is linked to an external file. Use BlockDefinition::SetExternalFileName
to set the name of the external file and enable or disable the link.
