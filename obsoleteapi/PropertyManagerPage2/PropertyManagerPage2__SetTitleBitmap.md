Remarks

You can only use this method to set properties
on the PropertyManager page before it is displayed or while it is closed.
See PropertyManagerPage2::Show and PropertyManagerPage2::Close for details.

Create the bitmap in the resources of your application.
 The bitmap
must have less than 256 colors. It is accessed via the ModuleHandle and
Identifier that is passed into this API.  The
recommended size for bitmaps is a square from 18- to 22-cells wide.  However,
the bitmap can be any size, as long as it fits on the title bar.

The bitmap appears transparent by mapping any white
(RGB(255,255,255)) cells to the current Property Manager page title bar
background color.  Remember
the special use of this color as you design your bitmap.

| If this method is... | Then the title bar contains... |
| Used | Specified bitmap starting at the left edge of the PropertyManager title bar, followed by the title bar text (see SldWorks::CreatePropertyManagerPage). |
| Not used | Only the text, centered on the title bar. |
