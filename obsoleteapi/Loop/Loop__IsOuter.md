# Loop::IsOuter

This method is obsolete
and has been superseded by Loop2::IsOuter.

Description

This method tells you if the loop is the outermost loop on the face.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = Loop.IsOuter ()

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return: | (BOOL) retval | TRUE if the loop is the outermost loop, FALSE if not |

Syntax (COM)

status = Loop->IsOuter ( &retval
)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) retval | TRUE if the loop is the outermost loop, FALSE if not |
| Return: | (HRESULT)status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

Some situations exist where no clear outer loop is defined. For example,
the cylindrical face of an extruded circle has two loops that could be
considered outer loops.
