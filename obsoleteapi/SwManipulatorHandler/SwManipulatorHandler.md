# SwManipulatorHandler Object

This object is obsolete and has been superseded
by SwManipulatorHandler2.

Must be implemented by an add-in application to
interact with a manipulator. The add-in application performs such actions
as:

* Defining
  how a manipulator moves. For example, the add-in application has the manipulator
  follow a surface in order to place an image on that surface.
* Providing
  any temporary graphics associated with manipulator. For example, to display
  a temporary body in a part, the add-in application must call Body2::Display2.
* Applying
  transforms using Body2::ApplyTransform.

To create a manipulator, first create the SwManipulatorHandler
object and then create the Manipulator object.
