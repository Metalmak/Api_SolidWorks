# FeatureManager::InsertMacroFeature

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by [FeatureManager::InsertMacroFeature2](FeatureManager__InsertMacroFeature2.htm).

Description

This method inserts a macro
feature in this model.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = FeatureManager.InsertMacroFeature ( baseName,
progId, macroMethods, paramNames, paramTypes, paramValues, editBody, options
)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BSTR) baseName | Name of the base feature (see Remarks) |
| Input: | (BSTR) progId | Indicates whether to use COM or VBA callback methods (see Remarks) |
| Input: | (VARIANT) macroMethods | Array of size 9 in string (see Remarks) |
| Input: | (VARIANT) paramNames | Array of parameters of size paramCount |
| Input: | (VARIANT) paramTypes | Array of types of parameters of size paramCount as defined by swMacroFeatureParamType\_e in long |
| Input: | (VARIANT) paramValues | Array of values of parameters of size paramCount in string |
| Input: | (LPBODY2) editBody | Body to modify in the macro feature |
| Input: | (long) options | Placement of the macro feature in the FeatureManager design tree as defined by swMacroFeatureOptions\_e |
| Output: | (LPFEATURE) retval | Pointer to the macro feature |

Syntax (COM)

status = FeatureManager->IInsertMacroFeature (
baseName, progId, macroMethods, paramCount, paramNames, paramTypes, paramValues,
editBody, options, &retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BSTR) baseName | Name of the base feature (see Remarks) |

| Input: | (BSTR) \*macroMethods | Array of size 9 in string (see Remarks) |
| Input: | (long) paramCount | Number of parameters |
| Input: | (BSTR) \*paramNames | Array of parameters of size paramCount |
| Input: | (long) \*paramTypes | Array of types of parameters of size paramCount as defined by swMacroFeatureParamType\_e in long |

| Input: | (long) options | Placement of the macro feature in the FeatureManager design tree as defined by swMacroFeatureOptions\_e |
| Output: | (LPFEATURE) retval | Pointer to the macro feature |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

baseName

* The
  argument baseName is serialized within the feature and cannot be changed.
* You
  can find out the name of the base feature by using MacroFeatureData::GetBaseName.
* The
  baseName argument is also used to generate the name of the feature when
  the feature is first created.

ProgId

| To create a macro feature using the OLE version from VB or VBA... | Then the input arguments should be... |
| COM callback methods | InsertMacroFeature ( progId, empty,  ... ) |
| VBA callback methods | InsertMacroFeature ( "", callBackkMethods ... ) |

The progId argument is the name of the
program ID for the component that implements the COM callback methods.

macroMethods

The macroMethods argument is implemented
from VBA only and is a nine (9) element array of strings consisting of
the following values:

1. Filename
   - File executed during feature generation.
2. Module
   - Source module executed during feature generation.
3. Procedure
   - Source procedure executed during feature generation.
4. Filename
   - File executed after edit definition is selected.
5. Module
   - Source module executed after edit definition is selected.
6. Procedure
   - Source procedure executed after edit definition is selected.
7. Filename
   - File executed while querying security; optional, see the next paragraph.
8. Module
   - Source Module executed while querying security; optional, see the next
   paragraph.
9. Procedure
   - Source Procedure executed while querying security; optional, see the
   next paragraph.

Filename should be the full pathname to the
macro file. If the procedures are all self-contained in the same macro
file that calls FeatureManager::InsertMacroFeature, then a call to SldWorks::GetCurrentMacroPathName
will provide all of the information necessary for the Filename.

If a security procedure is not used, then
Filename, Module, and Procedure must all be empty strings.

Procedure names must
have an swm prefix in the name.
This prefix identifies the procedures to execute.

See Overview of Programming Macro Features for additional information
about declaring procedures.
