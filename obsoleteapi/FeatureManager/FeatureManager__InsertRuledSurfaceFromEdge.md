# FeatureManager::InsertRuledSurfaceFromEdge

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by FeatureManager::InsertRuledSurfaceFromEdge2.

Description

This method inserts a surface
from the selected edge on this feature.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = FeatureManager.InsertRuledSurfaceFromEdge
( type, length, flipPullDir, flipDir, trimAndSew, angle, coordInput, x,
y, z )

| Input: | (double) length | Distance at which to create the surface; valid for Tangent to Surface, Tapered to Vector, Perpendicular to Vector, and Sweep types only |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) flipPullDir | TRUE to flip the pull direction, FALSE to not; valid for Normal to Surface and Tapered to Vector types only |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) flipDir | TRUE to flip the direction, FALSE to not; valid for Perpendicular to Vector type only |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) trimAndSew | Trim and knit the surface, FALSE to not |
| Input: | (double) angle | Angle for Tapered to Vector type only |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) coordInput | TRUE to enable coordinate input, FALSE if not; for Sweep type only |
| Input: | (double) x | x coordinate |
| Input: | (double) y | y coordinate |
| Input: | (double) z | z coordinate |
| Output: | (LPFEATURE) retval | Pointer to the Feature object |
