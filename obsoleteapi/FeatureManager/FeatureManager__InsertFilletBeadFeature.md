# FeatureManager::InsertFilletBeadFeature

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by FeatureManager::InsertFilletBeadFeature2.

Description

This method inserts a fillet
weld bead feature.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = FeatureManager.InsertFilletBeadFeature (
type1, size1, length1, pitch, type2, size2, length2, flag, edgeNum1, deSelEdge1,
edgeNum2, deSelEdge2)

| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (short) type1 | First side:   * 0 = Full   length * 1 = Intermittent * 2 = Staggered |
| Input: | (double) size1 | Size of fillet on first side |
| Input: | (double) length1 | Length of fillet on first side |
| Input: | (double) pitch | Pitch, if Intermittent or Staggered on both sides |
| Input: | (short) type2 | Second side:   * 0= Full   length * 1 = Intermittent * 2= Staggered |
| Input: | (double) size2 | Size of fillet on second side |
| Input: | (double) length2 | Length of fillet on second side |
| Input: | (long) flag | 0 = One-sided and no tangent propagation  1 = Two-sided  2 = Tangent propagation  3 = Two-sided and tangent propagation |
| Input: | (long) edgeNum1 | Number of intersecting edges on first side |
| Input: | (VARIANT) deSelEdge1 | Array indicating if intersecting edges are selected (0) or deselected (1) on first side |
| Input: | (long) edgeNum2 | Number of intersecting edges on second side |
| Input: | (VARIANT) deSelEdge2 | Array indicating if intersecting edges are selected (0) or deselected (1) on second side |
| Output: | (LPFEATURE) retval | Pointer to the Feature object |
