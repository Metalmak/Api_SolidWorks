# FeatureManager::FeatureLinearPattern

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by FeatureManager::FeatureLinearPattern2.

Description

This method inserts a linear
pattern feature of the selected features or components.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = FeatureManager.FeatureLinearPattern ( num1,
spacing1, num2, spacing2, flipDir1, flipDir2, dName1, dName2 )

#

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) num1 | Number of instances of the linear pattern in Direction 1, including the original |
| Input: | (double) spacing1 | Spacing between each instance of the linear pattern in Direction 1 in meters |
| Input: | (long) num2 | Number of instances of the linear pattern in Direction 2, including the original |
| Input: | (double) spacing2 | Spacing between each instance of the linear pattern in Direction 2 in meters |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) flipDir1 | TRUE if you want to reverse the direction the linear pattern in Direction 1, FALSE if not |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) flipDir2 | TRUE if you want to reverse the direction of the linear pattern in Direction 2, FALSE if not |
| Input: | (BSTR) dName1 | Name of the dimension defining Direction 1 |
| Input: | (BSTR) dName2 | Name of the dimension defining in Direction 2 |
| Output: | (LPFEATURE) \*retval | Pointer to the Feature object |

Syntax (COM)

status = FeatureManager->FeatureLinearPattern
( num1, spacing1, num2, spacing2, flipDir1, flipDir2, dName1, dName2,
retval )

| Input: | (long) num2 | Number of instances of the linear pattern in Direction 2, including the original |
| Input: | (double) spacing2 | Spacing between each instance of the linear pattern in Direction 2, meters |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) flipDir1 | TRUE if you want to reverse the direction the linear pattern in Direction 1 |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) flipDir2 | TRUE if you want to reverse the direction of the linear pattern in Direction 2, FALSE if not |
| Input: | (BSTR) dName1 | Name of the dimension defining Direction 1 |
| Input: | (BSTR) dName2 | Name of the dimension defining Direction 2 |
| Output: | (LPFEATURE) \*retval | Pointer to the Feature object |
| Return: | (HRESULT) status | S\_OK if successful |

Remarks

This method requires ordered selection of the features
and components.

* Features.
  Use ModelDocExtension::SelectByID 1 and 2 for the directions and ModelDocExtension::SelectByID
  4 for the features to pattern.
* Components.
  Use ModelDocExtension::SelectByID 1 for the components to pattern and
  ModelDocExtension::SelectByID 2 and 4 for the directions.
