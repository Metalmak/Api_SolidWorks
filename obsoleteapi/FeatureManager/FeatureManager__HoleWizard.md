Remarks

Screw Fit
- As defined in swWzdHoleScrewClearanceTypes\_e and only used if user does
not specify a hole diameter; default value is NORMAL\_FIT

Drill Angle
- defaults to 118°
if not specified

Input Metrics
- Input angles in radians; input values in meters

Parameters for this method:

* The fastenerTypeIndex
  parameter has to match the standard and be valid for that hole type or
  an error occurs.
* The sSize
  parameter must be a valid size for fastener type or an error occurs.
* The value1
  through value12 parameters are different for each type of hole. The possible
  values are as follows, organized by hole type. SolidWorks ignores parameters
  set to -1.

value1 through value12 for different types
of holes:

### Counterbore Holes

Head clearance – Added to either
the input counterbore depth or the counterbore depth in the standard.

Parameters for all counterbore holes:

1. Hole Diameter
2. Hole Depth
3. CounterBore Diameter
4. CounterBore Depth
5. HeadClearance
6. Screw Fit
7. Drill Angle
8. Near Csink Diameter
9. Near Csink Angle
10. Bot Csink Diameter
11. Bot Csink Angle
12. Far Csink Diameter
13. Far Csink Angle
14. Offset

### Countersink Holes

Head clearance type - Value
from swWzdHoleCounterSinkHeadClearanceTypes\_e, which represents how to
add the head clearance values to the hole.

Parameters for all countersink holes:

1. Hole Diameter
2. Hole Depth
3. Near Csink Diameter
4. Near Csink Angle
5. Head Clearance
6. Screw Fit
7. Drill Angle
8. Far Csink Diameter
9. Far Csink Angle
10. Offset
11. Head Clearance Type

### Regular Holes

Parameters for all holes:

1. Hole Diameter
2. Hole Depth
3. Screw Fit
4. Drill Angle
5. Near Csink Diameter
6. Near Csink Angle
7. Far Csink Diameter
8. Far Csink Angle
9. Offset

### Pipe Tapped Holes

Tap Drill Depth – Depth can
be setup as a ratio from the standard thread depth or the input thread
depth. If the user does specify a tap drill depth, the calculation from
the thread depth is replaced with the specified depth.

Cosmetic Thread Type - Defaults
to swCosmeticThreadTypeNone from swWzdHoleCosmeticThreadTypes\_e.

Near countersink angle - Can
be calculated from standard data as a default.

Parameters for all ptap holes:

1. Tap drill diameter
2. Tap drill depth
3. Thread Depth
4. Near Csink Diameter
5. Near Csink Angle
6. Far Csink Diameter
7. Far Csink Angle
8. Drill Angle
9. Cosmetic Thread Type
10. Offset

### Tap Holes

Tap Drill Depth - If the user
specifies a tap drill depth, SolidWorks always uses this depth. Tap drill
depths can be calculated:

1. For helicoil holes: Tap drill depth is calculated
   based on a constant \* tap drill diameter + allowance for tap type (bottoming
   or plug).
2. For tapped holes: Tap drill depth is calculated
   from the thread length + advance + allowance for tap type (bottoming or
   plug).

Thread Depth – If the user specifies
thread depth, SolidWorks always uses this depth. Tap drill depths can
be calculated:

1. For helicoil holes: Thread depth is calculated
   based on a constant (determined by hole type i.e. Insert = 1.0 \* Dia)
   + thread depth from the standard \* thread major diameter.
2. For tapped holes: based on 2 \* thread diameter

Cosmetic Thread Type - Specified
as defined in swWzdHoleCosmeticThreadTypes\_e

Hcoil Tap Type - Defaults to
swTapTypePlug as defined in swWzdHoleHcoilTapTypes\_e. Used only for the
helicoil standard holes.

Thread end condition - Defaults
to swThreadEndConditionBLIND as defined in swWzdHoleThreadEndCondition\_e.

Parameters for all ptap holes:

1. Tap drill diameter
2. Tap drill depth
3. Thread Depth
4. Near Csink Diameter
5. Near Csink Angle
6. Far Csink Diameter
7. Far Csink Angle
8. Drill Angle
9. Cosmetic Thread Type
10. Thread End Condition
11. Helicoil Tap Type
12. Offset

### Legacy Holes

For legacy types of holes standardIndex, fastenerTypeIndex, sSize are
not relevant and SolidWorks ignores them.
