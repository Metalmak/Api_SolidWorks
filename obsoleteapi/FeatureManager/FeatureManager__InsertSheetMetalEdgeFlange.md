# FeatureManager::InsertSheetMetalEdgeFlange

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by FeatureManager::InsertSheetMetalEdgeFlange2.

Description

This method inserts an edge
flange in this sheet metal part.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

pFeat = FeatureManager.InsertSheetMetalEdgeFlange
( flangeEdge, sketchFeat, booleanOptions, dAngle, dRadius, bendPosition,
dOffsetDist, reliefType, dReliefRatio, dReliefWidth, dReliefDepth, flangeSharpType,
pCBA)

Remarks

Before calling this method, call ModelDoc2::InsertSketchForEdgeFlange
and create a profile for the flange. After creating the profile, call
this method to create the flange.
