Remarks

You must use ModelDocExtension::SelectByID2
and the following Mark values to select edges that bound the surface to
be filled:

* Boundary
  curves = 1
* Boundary
  with contact curvature control = 257
* Boundary
  with tangent curvature control = 513
* Constraint
  curves or internal curves = 4

The resolution argument can
be set to 1, 2, or 3. The higher the value, the better the resolution.

Use the Body2::Diagnose and
the DiagnoseResult APIs to get the gaps to fill.
