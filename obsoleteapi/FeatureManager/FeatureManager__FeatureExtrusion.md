# FeatureManager::FeatureExtrusion

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by FeatureManager::FeatureExtrusion2.

Description

This method creates an extruded feature.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

pFeat = FeatureManager.FeatureExtrusion ( sd, flip,
dir, t1, t2, d1, d2, dchk1, dchk2, ddir1, ddir2, dang1, dang2, offsetReverse1,
offsetReverse2, translateSurface1, translateSurface2, merge, useFeatScope,
useAutoSelect )

| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) sd | TRUE for single ended, FALSE for double ended |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) flip | TRUE to flip the direction to cut |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) dir | TRUE to flip the direction to extrude |
| Input: | (long) t1 | Termination type for first end as defined in swEndConditions\_e |

| Input: | (double) d1 | Depth of extrusion for first end in meters |
| Input: | (double) d2 | Depth of extrusion for second end in meter |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) dchk1 | TRUE allows draft angle in first direction, FALSE does not allow drafting |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) dchk2 | TRUE allows draft angle in second direction, FALSE does not allow drafting |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) ddir1 | TRUE for first draft angle to be inward, FALSE to be outward |

| Input: | (double) dang1 | Draft angle for first end |
| Input: | (double) dang2 | Draft angle for second end |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) offsetReverse1 | If you chose to offset the first end condition from another face or plane, then TRUE specifies offset in direction away from the sketch, FALSE specifies offset from the face or plane in direction toward the sketch |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) offsetReverse2 | If you chose to offset the second end condition from another face or plane, then TRUE specifies offset in direction away from the sketch, FALSE specifies offset from the face or plane in direction toward the sketch |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) translateSurface1 | When you choose swEndcondOffsetFromSurface as the termination type for the first end, then TRUE specifies that the end of the extrusion is a translation of the reference surface, FALSE specifies to use a true offset |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) translateSurface2 | When you choose swEndcondOffsetFromSurface as the termination type for the second end, then TRUE specifies that the end of the extrusion is a translation of the reference surface, FALSE specifies to use a true offset |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) merge | TRUE to merge the results in a multibody part, FALSE to not |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) useFeatScope | TRUE if the feature only affects selected bodies, FALSE if the feature affects all bodies |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) useAutoSelect | TRUE to automatically select all bodies and have the feature affect those bodies, FALSE to select the bodies the feature affects (see Remarks) |
| Output: | (LPFEATURE) pFeat | Pointer to the feature object |

Remarks

When useAutoSelect is FALSE, the user must select
the bodies that the feature will affect.

When using cut or cavity features that result in
multiple bodies, you cannot select to keep all of the resulting bodies
or one or more selected bodies.

To extrude a 3D sketch, select:

* 3D sketch
  with selection mark 0
* Extrusion
  direction edge with selection mark 16
