# FeatureManager::FeatureCircularPattern

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by FeatureManager::FeatureCircularPattern2.

This method inserts a circular
pattern feature in the selected features or components.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = FeatureManager.FeatureCircularPattern (
num, spacing, flipDir, dName )

#

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) num | Number of instances of the circular pattern to insert, including the original |
| Input: | (double) spacing | Spacing between each instance of the circular pattern in radians |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) flipDir | TRUE to flip the direction of the circular pattern |
| Input: | (BSTR) dName | Name of the angular dimension defining the direction of the pattern |
| Output: | (LPFEATURE) \*retval | Pointer to the Feature object |

#

Syntax (COM)

status = FeatureManager->FeatureCircularPattern
( num, spacing, flipDir, dName, retval )

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (long) num | Number of instances of the circular pattern to insert, including the original |
| Input: | (double) spacing | Spacing between each instance of the circular pattern in radians |
| Input: | (VARIANT\_BOOL) flipDir | TRUE to flip the direction of the circular pattern |
| Input: | (BSTR) dName | Name of the angular dimension defining the direction of the pattern |
| Output: | (LPFEATURE) \*retval | Pointer to the Feature object |

Remarks

This method requires ordered selection of the features and components.

* Features.
  Use ModelDocExtension::SelectByID 4 for the features to pattern.
* Components.
  Use ModelDocExtension::SelectByID 1 for the components to pattern and
  ModelDocExtension::SelectByID 2 for the axis.
