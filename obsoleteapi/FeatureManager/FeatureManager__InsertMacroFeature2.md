# FeatureManager::InsertMacroFeature2

This method is obsolete and has been superseded
by FeatureManager::InsertMacroFeature3.

Description

This method inserts a macro
feature in this model.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

retval = FeatureManager.InsertMacroFeature2 ( baseName,
progId, macroMethods, paramNames, paramTypes, paramValues, dimTypes, dimValues,
editBody, iconFiles, options)

Remarks

baseName

* The
  argument baseName is serialized within the feature and cannot be changed.
* You
  can find out the name of the base feature by using MacroFeatureData::GetBaseName.
* The baseName argument is also used to generate
  the name of the feature when the feature is first created.

ProgId

| To create a macro feature using the OLE version from VB or VBA... | Then the input arguments should be... |
| COM callback methods | The progId argument is the name of the program ID for the component that implements the COM callback methods. The object that is represented by progID must support the swComFeature interface.    InsertMacroFeature2 ("Sample", "Sample.MyFeature", \_            Nothing, paramNames, paramTypes, \_                 paramValues, dimTypes, dimValues, \_                     editbody, iconFiles, \_                     swMacroFeatureByDefault)    In the COM server, the Sample.Feature class is derived or supports the SwComFeature interface methods. These methods support the macro feature's rebuild, edit, and security functions. |
| VBA callback methods | InsertMacroFeature ( "", callBackMethods ... ) |

macroMethods

The macroMethods argument is implemented
from VBA only and is a nine (9) element array of strings consisting of
the following values:

1. Filename
   - File executed during feature generation.
2. Module
   - Source module executed during feature generation.
3. Procedure
   - Source procedure executed during feature generation.
4. Filename
   - File executed after edit definition is selected.
5. Module
   - Source module executed after edit definition is selected.
6. Procedure
   - Source procedure executed after edit definition is selected.
7. Filename
   - File executed while querying security; optional, see the next paragraph.
8. Module
   - Source Module executed while querying security; optional, see the next
   paragraph.
9. Procedure
   - Source Procedure executed while querying security; optional, see the
   next paragraph.

Filename should be the full pathname to the
macro file. If the procedures are all self-contained in the same macro
file that calls FeatureManager::InsertMacroFeature2, then a call to SldWorks::GetCurrentMacroPathName
will provide all of the information necessary for the Filename.

If a security procedure is not used, then
Filename, Module, and Procedure must all be empty strings.

Procedure names must
have an swm prefix in the name.
This prefix identifies the procedures to execute.

dimTypes

Only these dimension types are supported
by this method:

* swAngularDimension
* swLinearDimension
* swRadialDimension

iconFiles

VARIANT containing an array of three strings
that refer to Windows bitmap images for the regular, suppressed, and highlighted
images for the custom macro feature icon.

* Images must be Windows
  bitmap (\*.bmp) format and be 16 pixels wide X 18 pixels high
* Either the full pathname
  or only the filename can be used; for example, c:\bitmaps\icon1.bmp
  or icon1.bmp.
* The first string in
  the array is for the regular icon bitmap, the second string is for suppressed
  icon bitmap, and the third string is for highlighted icon bitmap.
