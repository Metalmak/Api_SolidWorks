# Security Function

The security function for a macro feature is optional for a VBA-based
macro feature, but required for a COM-based macro feature. This function:

1. Optionally calls IFeature::GetDefinition to obtain the
   IMacroFeatureData
   object from the input feature.
2. Optionally gets the properties of the IMacroFeatureData
   object.
3. Optionally processes the following information to ascertain security:

   * Security function input arguments
   * Macro feature data properties from step 2
4. Must return a security value that is a combination of the values
   in swMacroFeatureSecurityOptions\_e.
   (Steps 1-3 can determine at runtime what value to return, but you can also
   hardcode a static return value.)

**NOTE:**  If you call IFeature::GetDefinition from this security
function, you may cause an infinite recursion, as the security function calls
itself to check whether the macro feature can be edited whenever
IFeature::GetDefinition is called on a macro feature. To prevent a possible
recursion, set a static global flag in the security function after you call
IFeature::GetDefinition the first time.

This following example illustrates a VBA-based security function that
hardcodes the return value (step 4 above):

Public Function swmSecurity(app As Variant,
part As Variant, feature As Variant) As Variant

' If the file security.txt exists, then
enable displaying a note

' for the macro feature

' See IFeatureManager::InsertSecurityNote
for more information about

' notes and macro features

    Dim
nSecurityOptions As swMacroFeatureSecurityOptions\_e

    nSecurityOptions
= swMacroFeatureSecurityByDefault

    Dim
fso As FileSystemObject

    If
(fso Is Nothing) Then

        Set
fso = New Scripting.FileSystemObject

    End
If

    If
(Not (fso Is Nothing)) Then

        If
(fso.FileExists("C:\Test\MacroFeatureSamples\security.txt"))
Then

            nSecurityOptions
= nSecurityOptions Or swMacroFeatureSecurityEnableNote

        End
If

    End
If

    swmSecurity
= nSecurityOptions

End Function
