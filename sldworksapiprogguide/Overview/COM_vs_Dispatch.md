# COM vs. Dispatch

The SOLIDWORKS software exposes its API functionality through standard
COM objects. For OLE automation, the API is exposed using IDispatch.

COM implementations provide:

* Your application direct access to the underlying
  objects or arrays, and, subsequently, increased performance.
* Slightly more functionality and also [return
  an HRESULT](Return_Values.htm) value for each API call.

The COM interface is recommended for all add-in DLL projects. For executable
(.exe) implementations, you can use the COM interface unless the method
or property passes an array. In this case, use the equivalent Dispatch
method that uses a VARIANT to encapsulate the array.
