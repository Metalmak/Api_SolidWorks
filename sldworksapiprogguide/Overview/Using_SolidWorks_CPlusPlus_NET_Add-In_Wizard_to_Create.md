# Using the SOLIDWORKS COM Non-Attributed Add-in Wizard to Create a C++/CLI Add-in

This topic describes how to use the
SOLIDWORKS
COM Non-Attributed Add-in Wizard to create Visual C++/CLI add-ins in
Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2005 or later.

  SOLIDWORKS
  COM Non-Attributed Add-in Wizard](#Wizard)
* [Examining Visual C++/CLI Add-In Files Created by the
  SOLIDWORKS COM Non-Attributed
  Add-in Wizard](#Files)

NOTES:

* The SOLIDWORKS COM
  Non-Attributed Add-in Wizard is included in the [SOLIDWORKS
  API SDK](../GettingStarted/SolidWorks_API_Getting_Started_Overview.htm).
* The Visual C++/CLI Add-in allows the use of MFC objects.

## Creating a Visual C++/CLI Add-in Using the SOLIDWORKS COM Non-Attributed Add-in Wizard

1. Click Start > Programs
   > Microsoft Visual Studio *version\_number* > Microsoft
   Visual Studio *version\_number*.
2. Click the New
   Project button.

1. Select Visual C++
   > SOLIDWORKS
   COM Non-Attributed Addin from the templates list.
2. Enter the name of your project in Name.
3. Enter the directory of your project in **Location**.
4. Click OK.

3. Type the name of your add-in in Short
   name. The other fields are automatically filled in using this name.
4. Click Options.

1. Under Threading,
   select the threading option for the project.
2. Under Interface,
   select whether or not to add the oleautomation
   attribute to your code by selecting Automation
   Compatible.

5. Click SwOptions.

1. Under AddinEvents,
   select the events for which you want to listen:

* SOLIDWORKS
  Events. Fired by the SOLIDWORKS application.
* Part
  Events. Fired by individual part documents.
* Assembly
  Events. Fired by individual assembly documents.
* Drawing
  Events. Fired by individual
  drawing documents.
* Model
  View Events. Fired by individual model views in each document.

It is recommended that you leave the SOLIDWORKS Events check box selected
because:

* This check box
  must be selected to listen to any of the other events.
* You can use this
  event's code as sample code if you decide to include event handling in
  the future.

Model views are created in individual documents.
To listen for a model view event, you must be listening to the basic document.
Thus, the Model View Events check
box is not available until you select at least one of these check boxes:
Part Events, Assembly
Events, or Drawing Events.

2. Under Addin
   User Interface, select Create
   Property Page to include an add-in PropertyManager page. This page
   is displayed in the SOLIDWORKS application and should contain controls
   to extend the add-in's user interface.

6. Click Finish.

Wait for the SOLIDWORKS COM Non-Attributed Addin Wizard to
customize your add-in and set up the project.

## Examining Visual C++/CLI Add-In Files Created by the SOLIDWORKS COM Non-Attributed Add-in Wizard

| C++ Add-in File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| SwAddin*n*.rgs | This file contains the information that automatically registers your   add-in with SOLIDWORKS when it is compiled. You can change Name  and Description to better indicate the purpose of your add-in.    **NOTE:** SwAddin*n*.rgs is the generic name for this file. The letter *n*  is automatically inserted and incremented by the wizard to make the project files unique. |
| BitmapHandler.cpp and corresponding .h file | Images for COM add-ins (toolbars, bitmap buttons, and so on) are bitmaps stored in the DLL as resources. To use any of these images with SOLIDWORKS, you must retrieve the image and save it to a file. You can then pass the path to the file as an argument to the methods that use the image. The BitmapHandler object facilitates this effort.     To use the BitmapHandler object, call CreateFileFromResourceBitmap   and pass it the resource name of the image you want to retrieve. The function creates the file in the system's temporary folder and returns the full path. If you then pass this path to a method, SOLIDWORKS can load the image. |
| CSwAddin*n*Dialog.cpp and corresponding .h file | This file is included to demonstrate compatibility with MFC. |
| DocView.cpp and corresponding .h file | This file contains the definition of the DocView object. If an add-in   is listening for ModelView events, then there is a DocView instance for   each open ModelView. |
| PMPageHandler.cpp and corresponding .h file | This file contains the class that implements the IPropertyManagerPage2Handler*n* interface. An instance of this object is passed to SOLIDWORKS when creating a PropertyManager page. When a control on the page is manipulated, the corresponding function in this object is called. |
| stdafx.cpp and corresponding .h file | This file contains the #import statements for the SOLIDWORKS type libraries and any other necessary SOLIDWORKS #include statements.     Because a PropertySheet member exists in the VC7 libraries, IModelDoc2::PropertySheet was redefined to IModelDoc2::SwPropertySheet in the #import statement for sldworks.tlb. |
| SwAddin*n*.cpp and corresponding .h file | This is the main add-in file. It contains the implementation of the   ISwAddin interface.     ISwAddin::ConnectToSw and ISwAddin::DisconnectFromSw are the entry and exit functions for this add-in. This file also contains the user interface and SOLIDWORKS event callback functions.    **NOTE:** SwAddin*n*.cpp is the generic name for this file. The letter n  is automatically inserted and incremented by the wizard to make the project files unique. |
| SwAddin*n*.def | This file declares DLL function exports. |
| SwAddin*n*.idl | This file is used to generate the type library for the add-in. |
| SwAddin*n*\_module.cpp | Generated by Visual Studio, this file contains COM definitions for the DLL. |
| SwDocument.cpp and corresponding .h file | This file contains the CSwDocument class that handles events thrown   by open model documents. There is an instance of this class for every   open model document. |
| UserPropertyManagerPage.cpp and corresponding .h file | This file contains the wrapper class for the SOLIDWORKS IPropertyManagerPage2. A PropertyManager page allows you to extend the user interface for your add-in with standard buttons, check boxes, and so on.     The function AddControls controls the layout of the PropertyManager   page. All controls must be added to group boxes on the page. Group boxes are displayed in the order in which they are added. Controls in a group box are displayed in the order in which they are added to the group box. |
