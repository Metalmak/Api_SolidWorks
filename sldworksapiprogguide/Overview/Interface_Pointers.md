# SOLIDWORKS API Help

# Interface Pointers

Interface pointers can be an area of confusion with unmanaged C++ programming.
Each SOLIDWORKS API method that returns an interface pointer automatically
increments the reference count on the interface pointer by 1.

* COM implementations.
  You can call a SOLIDWORKS API that returns an interface pointer. You can
  then use this pointer as you like, but you are responsible for releasing
  it.

This unmanaged C++ COM example demonstrates
how to handle interface pointers.

{

> LPMODELDOC2 m\_ModelDoc
> = NULL;
>
> // Get the IModelDoc pointer
>
> HRESULT res = UserApp->getSWApp()->get\_IActiveDoc(
> &m\_ModelDoc );
>
> if( m\_ModelDoc ==
> NULL )
>
> return;
>
> LPPARTDOC m\_PartDoc
> = NULL;
>
> // Get the IPartDoc pointer
>
> res = m\_ModelDoc->QueryInterface(IID\_IPartDoc,
> (LPVOID \*)&m\_PartDoc);
>
> ASSERT( res == S\_OK
> );
>
> .
>
> .
>
> // Use the interface pointers within your
> code and then release them when done
>
> .
>

>
> m\_ModelDoc->Release(); //
> Release the IModelDoc2 pointer
>
> m\_PartDoc->Release(); //
> Release the IPartDoc pointer

}

NOTE: LPINTERFACE
is a typedef and a pointer
to the named interface. e.g., LPPARTDOC
points to the PartDoc interface, LPMODELDOC2
points to the ModelDoc2 interface, etc.

You can also use [smart pointers](Smart_Pointers.htm)
with COM implementations. CComPtr
is an ATL smart pointer. IInterfacePtr
(e.g., IModelDoc2Ptr)
is also a smart pointer that does many of the same things as CComPtr,
but it is not part of ATL. It is a typedef
that resolves to a \_com\_ptr\_t
 (defined
in comip.h) using  \_COM\_SMARTPTR\_TYPEDEF.
For more information about using smart pointers with container classes, see
[STL Container Classes and Smart Pointers](STL_Container_Classes_and_Smart_Pointers.htm).

For an example of using smart pointers, see
Access
Assembly Example (C++ COM).

* Dispatch implementations.
  The release of the interface pointer is hidden in the destructor of the
  Dispatch objects (for example, IModelDoc2, IFace2, and so on). This implies
  that attaching an interface pointer to more than one of these Dispatch
  objects will cause a release to be performed by each of the objects as
  they go out of scope. This will cause a problem because the reference
  count was only incremented once when the interface pointer was returned
  to you.

To avoid this problem, you must manually
increment the reference count ( pdisp->AddRef(); ) if you are attaching the interface
pointer to more than one object.

This C++ Dispatch example demonstrates how
to handle the reference count on interface pointers.

{

> LPDISPATCH modDisp;
>
> // Get interface
> pointer to the active document
>
> modDisp = UserApp->getSWApp()->GetActiveDoc();
>
> // Reference count on modDisp automatically
> incremented by 1
>
>
> if( modDisp
> == NULL )
>
> return;
>
> // Attach to the IModelDoc2 object
>
> IModelDoc2 m\_ModelDoc(
> modDisp );
>
> // Attach to the IPartDoc object
>
> IPartDoc m\_PartDoc(
> modDisp );
>
> // Manually
> increment the reference count on modDisp because
>
> // you use modDisp
> a second time
>
> modDisp->AddRef();
>
> .
>
> .
>
> // Use objects within your code
>
> .
>
> .
>
> // Variables go out of scope and destructors are
> called for IModelDoc2 and IPartDoc,
>
> // which decrements the reference count
> on modDisp by two
