# Programming Multibody Parts

This topic provides information about programming multibody
parts using the SOLIDWORKS API.

## Obsoleted methods and their replacements

When programming multibody parts:

| Do not use... | Instead, use... | Because... |
| IFeature::GetBody | IFeature::GetFaces  IFace2::GetBody | A feature can affect more than one body. Therefore, getting the faces created by a feature and getting the bodies to which the faces belong is a better way to get a feature's body or bodies. |
| IPartDoc::Body  IPartDoc::IBodyObject2 | * IPartDoc::GetBodies2 * IPartDoc::GetRelatedBodies * IPartDoc::EnumBodies3 * IPartDoc::EnumRelatedBodies2 | It no longer makes sense to get the body of a part if it contains multiple bodies. In a single-body part, IPartDoc::Body and IPartDoc::IBodyObject2 still return the body, but in a multibody part, they return NULL. |

## Changes to base features

Most of the methods for creating base features (cut and boss, including
thin features) belong to IFeatureManager:

| * Extrude * Revolve * Sweep | * Loft * Thicken |

These methods may include any of the following parameters that support
multibody parts:

| If this parameter... | Is set to... | Then... |
| Merge | True | Merging occurs and feature scope applies. |
|  | False | Merging does not occur and feature scope does not apply. |
| UseFeatScope | True | All currently selected bodies are affected. |
|  | False | All applicable bodies are affected. |
| UseAutoSelect | True | All applicable bodies are added to the selection list, which the user can edit. |
|  | False | User must select bodies. |

NOTES:

* The Merge parameter
  applies to bosses, but not to cuts.
* When the UseFeatScope
  parameter is set to false, it applies to all bodies including new bodies
  placed before the feature in the FeatureManager design tree.
* The UseAutoSelect
  parameter applies to the existing bodies only.

In the following example, three solid bodies exist: Extrude1, Extrude2,
and Extrude3. To create a through-all cut through Extrude1 and Extrude3,
you could do something like the following. Notice the use of the Mark
parameter.

Part.ModelDocExtension.SelectByID2 "Sketch5",
"SKETCH", 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, Nothing, swSelectOptionDefault   'cut
profile

Part.ModelDocExtension.SelectByID2 "Extrude3",
"SOLIDBODY",
0, 0, 0, 1, 1, Nothing, swSelectOptionDefault   'body
to affect

Part.ModelDocExtension.SelectByID2 "Extrude1",
"SOLIDBODY",
0, 0, 0, 1, 1, Nothing, swSelectOptionDefault   'body
to affect

Part.FeatureManager.FeatureCut4
1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0.058, 0.058, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.01, 0.01, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.0, 0, 0 'use feature scope, do not use
Autoselect

You can observe this by recording a macro and playing it back.

In the following example, again three solid bodies exist: Extrude1, Extrude2,
and Extrude. However, in this example, a through-all extrusion boss is created
and merges with Extrude1 and Extrude3. Notice the use of the Mark parameter and
that Merge is set to true.

Part.ModelDocExtension.SelectByID2  "Sketch4",
"SKETCH", 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, Nothing, swSelectOptionDefault   'boss
profile

Part.ModelDocExtension.SelectByID2  "Extrude3",
"SOLIDBODY",
0, 0, 0, 1, 1, Nothing, swSelectOptionDefault   'body
to affect

Part.ModelDocExtension.SelectByID2  "Extrude1",
"SOLIDBODY",
0,0,0, 1, 1, Nothing, swSelectOptionDefault   'body
to affect

Part.FeatureManager.FeatureExtrusion3
1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0.047, 0.047, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.01, 0.01, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0.0, 0 'merge, use feature scope, do
not use Autoselect

## Modifying the definition of solid features that use feature scope

The IExtrudeFeatureData2,
ILoftFeatureData,
IRevolveFeatureData2,
ISweepFeatureData,
and IThickenFeatureData
have methods and properties that support multibody parts:

| Methods: | * GetFeatureScopeBodiesCount * IGetFeatureScopeBodies * ISetFeatureScopeBodies |
| Properties: | * AutoSelect   (VARIANT\_BOOL) * FeatureScope   (VARIANT\_BOOL) * FeatureScopeBodies   (VARIANT array of bodies) |

When you get or set FeatureScopeBodies,
that feature then affects all bodies in that array. Make sure that any
bodies that you set in this array all exist and that IBody2
objects are valid when the feature is in its rolled-back state (after
AccessSelections
is called). If the bodies are not available, then you might have to reorder
features in the FeatureManager design tree to achieve the desired result.

Also, if FeatureScope
is set to false or merge is set to true, then GetFeatureScopeBodiesCount
returns 0 and FeatureScopeBodies
is an empty array.
