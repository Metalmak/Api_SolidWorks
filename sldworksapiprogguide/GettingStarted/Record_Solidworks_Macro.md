# Record SOLIDWORKS Macro

### To record a SOLIDWORKS macro:

1. Click Record\Pause
   Macro ![](../image/Tool_Pause_Record_Macro.gif) on the Macro toolbar, or click Tools,
   Macro, Record.
2. Perform the actions that you want to record.
3. When you are done recording, click Stop
   Macro ![](../image/tool_Stop_Macro.gif) on the Macro toolbar or click Tools,
   Macro, Stop.
4. In the dialog, type a name for the macro in File name, select the type of macro
   in Save as type, and click Save.

NOTES:

* [SOLIDWORKS 2018 offers Visual Studio Tools for
  Applications (VSTA)](VSTA_2015.htm).
* If you selected SW VBA Macros (\*.swp), then the .swp extension is automatically added
  to the filename.
* If you selected SW VSTA VB Macro (\*.vbproj), then a
  Visual Basic .NET project is created. Building or debugging the project
  creates an executable file with an filename extension of .dll.
* If you selected SW VSTA C# Macro (\*.csproj), then a
  C# project is created. Building or debugging the project creates an executable
  file with an filename extension of .dll.
* If you selected SW All Macros Types (\*.swp,
  \*.csproj, \*.vbproj),
  then a VBA macro file is created and VB.NET, and C# projects are created.
  A .swp extension is automatically
  added to the VBA macro's filename. Two folders are created for the VB.NET
  and C# projects.
* The VB.NET project
  folder's name is the name of the macro plus -vbnet.
* The C# project folder
  name is the name of the project plus -csharp.

  For example, if you saved the just recorded macro as Macro1
  and selected SW All Macros Types (\*.swp,
  \*.csproj, \*.vbproj) in Save as
  type, then the folder where you saved the macros would contain
  a file called Macro1.swp and two
  project folders, Macro1-vbnet
  and Macro1-csharp. The VB.NET
  and C# projects reside in their respective folders.

  NOTE: The Automatically edit
  macro after recording system option has no effect when you select
  to save a just recorded macro as SW All
  Macros Types (\*.swp, \*.csproj, \*.vbproj).

To pause while recording a macro, click Record\Pause
Macro ![](../image/Tool_Pause_Record_Macro.gif) or Tools,
Macro, Pause.
Click Record\Pause Macro ![](../image/Tool_Pause_Record_Macro.gif) again to continue recording.
