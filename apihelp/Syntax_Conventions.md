### Notation

All SOLIDWORKS and add-in API functions support the COM interface.
If you are using COM, the SOLIDWORKS or add-in API function returns an
HRESULT, and any
additional return values are passed by reference as arguments.

### Methods and arguments

The following syntax uses the SOLIDWORKS method, IModelDocExtension::SelectByID2,
which is a function that returns a BOOLEAN value. It passes nine arguments to the function.

| Visual Basic .NET | Dim boolstatus As Boolean = false  boolstatus = swModelExtension.SelectByID2("Point1", "SKETCHPPOINT", .2, .3, 0, False, 0, Nothing, swSelectOptionDefault) |
| Visual Basic for Applications (VBA): | Dim Result as Boolean  Result = swModelExtension.SelectByID2("Point1", "SKETCHPOINT", .2, .3, 0, False, 0, Nothing, swSelectOptionDefault) |
| C# | bool boolstatus = false;  boolstatus = swModelExtension.SelectByID2("Point1", "SKETCHPOINT", .2, .3, 0, false, 0, null, swSelectOptionDefault); |
| Unmanaged C++ Dispatch: | BOOL Result = FALSE;  Result = swModelExtension.SelectByID2(\_T("Point1"),\_T("SKETCHPOINT"), .2, .3, 0,0,0,0,swSelectOptionDefault); |
| Unmanaged C++ COM: | VARIANT\_BOOL Result = FALSE;  HRESULT hres = swModelExtension->SelectByID2(\_T("Point1"),\_T("SKETCHPOINT"),.2,.3, 0,0,0,0,swSelectOptionDefault,&result); |
| C++/CLI | bool bSelected = swModelExtension->SelectByID2(swBody->Name, "SOLIDBODY", 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, true, 0, nullptr, (int)swSelectOption\_e::swSelectOptionDefault); |

NOTE: The return value in the
Visual Basic (Usage) section in
the Help is always shown as value.
Because some methods and properties contain an argument named Value,
SOLIDWORKS recommends that you rename the return value variable value to something meaningful to avoid
an error in your code and for clarity.

The next example uses the SOLIDWORKS method, IDrawingDoc::EditSheet,
which is a subroutine which returns nothing (void).
The method accepts no arguments.

| Visual Basic .NET | swDrawing.EditSheet() |
| Visual Basic for Applications (VBA): | swDrawing.EditSheet (see the **Note** below this table) |
| C# | swDrawing.EditSheet(); |
| Unmanaged C++ Dispatch: | swDrawing.EditSheet(); |
| Unmanaged C++ COM: | HRESULT hres = swDrawing->EditSheet(); |
| C++/CLI | swDrawing->EditSheet(); |

**NOTE:** Some methods are subroutines (that return nothing
(**void**)) that also pass arguments. The VBA syntax for those methods is
slightly different, despite what the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) Syntax
section of the help indicates. The help shows parentheses in the method
signatures of all VBA methods. In practice, parentheses are not used in the VBA
method signature of subroutines that return nothing. For example,
IModelDoc2::SetUnits is a subroutine that returns nothing but passes arguments.
The correct way to call IModelDoc2::SetUnits in VBA:

Part.SetUnits swINCHES,
swFRACTION, 16, 0, False

### Return values

The following syntax uses the SOLIDWORKS method, IModelDoc2::GetType,
which is a subroutine that returns a long value. This function takes no arguments. Instead,
it uses the current IModelDoc2
object and returns its type.

| Visual Basic .NET | int docType = 0;  docType = swModel.GetType(); |
| Visual Basic for Applications (VBA): | Dim docType As Long  docType = swModel.GetType |
| C# | int docType = 0;  docType = swModel.GetType(); |
| Unmanaged C++ Dispatch: | long docType = 0;  docType = swModel.GetType(); |
| Unmanaged C++ COM: | long docType = 0;  HRESULT hres = swModel->GetType( &docType ); |
| C++/CLI | swDocumentTypes\_e  nDocumentType;  nDocumentType = (swDocumentTypes\_e)swModel->GetType(); |

### Interfaces

Some functions have different versions of syntax. A function has multiple
interfaces only when required. Always check the See
Also link near the bottom of topic to see if a function has multiple
interfaces (e.g., IBody2::GetFirstFace
and IBody2::IGetFirstFace).

| Visual Basic .NET | Dim swFace as Face2 = Nothing  swFace = swBody.GetFirstFace |
| Visual Basic for Applications (VBA): | Dim swFace As Object  Set swFace = swBody.GetFirstFace |
| C# | Face2 swFace = null;  swFace = (Face2) swBody.GetFirstFace(); |
| Unmanaged C++ Dispatch: | IDispatch\* faceDisp = NULL;  faceDisp = swBody.GetFirstFace();  IFace2 swFace(faceDisp); |
| Unmanaged C++ COM: | LPFACE2 swFace = NULL;  HRESULT hres = swBody->IGetFirstFace( &swFace ); |
| C++/CLI | IFace2^   swFace = nullptr;  swFace = (IFace2^)swBody->GetFirstFace();            - or -  IFace2^   swFace = nullptr;  swFace = swBody->IGetFirstFace(); |

The Dispatch interface returns a Dispatch pointer, while the COM interface
returns an LPFACE2 pointer. The COM interface uses object pointers instead
of Dispatch pointers and pointers instead of VARIANT SafeArrays. Because
the argument types are different, any API function that handles objects
or arrays has two distinct interfaces, one for COM and one for Dispatch.

### Properties

The following syntax uses the SOLIDWORKS property IFeature::Name
to get and set the name of a feature.

| Visual Basic .NET | get:  set: | featName = swFeat.Name  swFeat.Name = featName |
| Visual Basic for Applications  (VBA): | get:  set: | featName = swFeat.Name  swFeat.Name = featName |
| C# | get:  set: | featName = swFeat.Name;  swFeat.Name = featName; |
| Unmanaged C++ Dispatch: | get:  set: | featName = swFeat.GetName();  swFeat.SetName(featName); |
| Unmanaged C++ COM: | get:  set: | hres = swFeat->get\_Name(&featName);  hres = swFeat->put\_Name(featName); |
| C++/CLI | get:  set: | featName = swFeat->Name;  swFeat->Name = featName; |

### Availability links

The Availability links appearing
at the bottom of a method, property, and delegate topic identifies the
release in which the method, property, or delegate was introduced. Topics
in the API Help lacking Availability
links indicate that the method, property, or delegate was introduced prior
to the SOLIDWORKS 98Plus release.
